<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he chief Intention of this Performance is to point out, and explain
to the Fair Sex, the Methods by which they may preserve and add to
their Charms; and by which many natural Blemishes and Imperfections
may be remedied or concealed. The same Share of Grace and Attractions
is not possessed by all of them; but while the Improvement of their
Persons is the indispensable Duty of those who have been little
favoured by Nature, it should not be neglected even by the few who have
received the largest Proportion of her Gifts. The same Art which will
communicate to the former the Power of pleasing, will enable the latter
to extend the Empire of their Beauty. It is possible to remove, or, at
least, to cover the Defects of the one Class, and to give Force and
Lustre to the Perfections of the other.</p>

<p>The Author, however, though in general he has framed his Work for the
Advantage of the Ladies, has not entirely confined it to them. The
Virtues of Plants and Vegetables, beside the Service they furnish for
the Toilet, have their Use in Articles of Luxury. He has thence been
induced to address himself also to the Perfumer: and his Publication,
he flatters himself, while it comprizes a very perfect Collection of
the Methods which tend to improve Beauty, to repair the Wastes of
Fatigue, and to avert the Marks of Age or Decline, includes likewise a
full Account of whatever relates to domestic Oeconomy and Expence.</p>

<p>Uncommon Pains have been taken to improve the present Edition, which
contains a System of the Cosmetic Art, infinitely superior to any that
has hitherto appeared; and it has likewise uniformly rendered the
various Prescriptions not only compatible with, but subservient to,
the Preservation, and even the Improvement of Health; an Object of the
greatest Importance in a Work of this Kind.</p>

<p class="center gesperrt">TOILET<br /></p>
<p class="center"><small><b>OF</b></small><br /></p>
<p class="center gesperrt">FLORA.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r1"></a>No. 1. <i>An Aromatic Bath.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>oil, for the space of two or three minutes, in a sufficient quantity
of river-water, one or more of the following plants; viz. Laurel,
Thyme, Rosemary, Wild Thyme, Sweet-Marjoram, Bastard-Marjoram,
Lavender, Southernwood, Wormwood, Sage, Pennyroyal, Sweet-Basil Balm,
Wild Mint, Hyssop, Clove-july-flowers, Anise, Fennel, or any other
herbs that have an agreeable scent. Hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>ing strained off the liquor
from the herbs, add to it a little Brandy, or camphorated Spirits of
Wine.</p>

<p>This is an excellent bath to strengthen the limbs; it removes pains
proceeding from cold, and promotes perspiration.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r2"></a>2. <i>A Cosmetic Bath.</i></p>

<p>Take two pounds of Barley or Bean-meal, eight pounds of Bran, and a
few handfuls of Borrage Leaves. Boil these ingredients in a sufficient
quantity of spring water. Nothing cleanses and softens the skin like
this bath.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r3"></a>3. <i>An Emollient Bath for the Feet.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil, in water, a pound of Bran, with a few Marsh-mallow Roots, and two
or three handfuls of Mallow Leaves.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r4"></a>4. <i>An Aromatic Bath for the Feet.</i></p>

<p>Take four handfuls of Pennyroyal, Sage, and Rosemary, three handfuls of
Angelica, and four ounces of Juniper Berries; boil these ingredients in
a sufficient quantity of water, and strain off the liquor for use.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r5"></a>5. <i>An excellent Preservative Balsam against the Plague.</i></p>

<p>Scrape fine twelve Scorzonera and Goatsbread Roots; simmer them over
a gentle fire in three quarts of Lisbon or French White Wine, in a
vessel closely covered, to prevent the too great evaporation of the
vinous spirit. When the roots are sufficiently boiled, strain off the
liquor through a linen strainer with a gentle pressure: then add to
it the Juice of twelve Lemons, with Cloves, Gin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>ger, Cardamom Seeds,
and Aloes Wood, grossly powdered, of each half an ounce; and about one
ounce of each of the following herbs, viz. fresh Leaves of Rue, Elder,
Bramble, and Sage; boil all together over a gentle fire, till one quart
is wasted away; strain the liquor off immediately through a strong
linen bag, and keep it in an earthen or glass vessel close stopped.
Drink every morning fasting, for nine days together, half a pint of
this Balsam, by which means you will be able to resist the malignancy
of the Atmosphere, though you even visit infected persons. The same end
may be promoted by washing the mouth and nostrils with Vinegar; and by
holding to the nose a bit of Camphire, slightly wrapped in muslin; or
by frequently chewing a piece of Gum Myrrh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p class="plabel"><a id="r6"></a>6. <i>An excellent Cosmetic for the Face.</i></p>

<p>Take a pound of levigated Hartshorn, two pounds of Rice Powder, half
a pound of Ceruss, Powder of dried Bones, Frankincense, Gum Mastic,
and Gum Arabic, of each two ounces. Dissolve the whole in a sufficient
quantity of Rose-water, and wash the face with this fluid.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r7"></a>7. <i>A curious Perfume.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil, in two quarts of Rose-water, an ounce of Storax, and two ounces
of Gum Benjamin; to which add, tied up in a piece of gauze or thin
muslin, six Cloves bruised, half a drachm of Labdanum, as much Calamus
Aromaticus, and a little Lemon-peel. Cover the vessel up close, and
keep the ingredients boiling a great while: strain off the liquor
without strong pressure, and let it stand till it deposit the sediment,
which keep for use in a box.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r8"></a>8. <i>Perfumed Chaplets and Medals.</i></p>

<p>Take Marechal Powder, and make it into a paste with Mucilage of Gum
Tragacanth and Arabic, prepared with All-flower-water (the receipt
for which is contained in this book.) The mould into which it is put
must be rubbed with a little Essence of Jassmine, or of any other
sweet-scented herb, to prevent the Paste from sticking. This Paste in
colour resembles Coffee.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r9"></a>9. <i>Receipt to thicken the Hair, and make it grow on a bald part.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Take Roots of a Maiden Vine, Roots of Hemp, and Cores of soft Cabbages,
of each two handfuls; dry and burn them; afterwards make a lye with the
ashes. The head is to be washed with this lye three days successively,
the part having been previously well rubbed with Honey.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r10"></a>10. <i>An approved Depilatory, or a Fluid for taking off the Hair.</i></p>

<p>Take Polypody of the Oak, cut into very small pieces; put them into a
glass vessel, and pour on them as much Lisbon, or French White Wine,
as will rise about an inch above the ingredients: digest in balneo
Mariæ (or a bath of hot water) for twenty-four hours; then distil off
the liquor by the heat of boiling water, till the whole has come over
the helm. A linen cloth wetted with this fluid, may be applied to the
part on which the hair grows, and kept on it all night; repeating the
application periodically till the hair falls off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The distilled water of the Leaves and Roots of Celandine, applied in
the same manner, has the like effect.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r11"></a>11. <i>A Powder to prevent Baldness.</i></p>

<p>Powder your head with powdered Parsley Seed, at night, once in three or
four months, and the hair will never fall off.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r12"></a>12. <i>To quicken the Growth of Hair.</i></p>

<p>Dip the teeth of your comb every morning in the expressed Juice
of Nettles, and comb the hair the wrong way. This expedient will
surprisingly quicken the growth of the hair.</p>

<p>Some, after having shaved the head, foment it with a decoction of
Wormwood, Southernwood, Sage, Betony, Vervain, Marjoram, Myrtle, Roses,
Dill, Rosemary, or Misletoe.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r13"></a>13. <i>A compound Oil for the same Intention.</i></p>

<p>Take half a pound of green Southernwood bruised, boil it in a pint and
a half <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>of Sweet Oil, and half a pint of Red Wine; when sufficiently
boiled, remove it from the fire, and strain off the liquor through a
linen bag: repeat this operation three times with fresh Southernwood.
The last time add to the strained liquor two ounces of Bears-grease.</p>

<p>This oil quickly makes the hair shoot out.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r14"></a>14. <i>A Fluid to make the Hair grow.</i></p>

<p>Take the tops of Hemp as soon as the plant begins to appear above
ground, and infuse them four and twenty hours in water. Dip the teeth
of the comb in this fluid, and it will certainly quicken the growth of
the hair.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r15"></a>15. <i>A Liniment of the same Kind.</i></p>

<p>Take six drachms of Labdanum, two ounces of Bears-grease, half an ounce
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Honey, three drachms of powdered Southernwood, a drachm and a half
of Ashes of Calamus Aromaticus Roots, three drachms of Balsam of Peru,
and a little Oil of Sweet Almonds. Mix into a liniment.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r16"></a>16. <i>To change the Colour of the Hair.</i></p>

<p>First wash your head with spring-water, then dip your comb in Oil of
Tartar, and comb yourself in the Sun: repeat this operation three times
a day, and at the end of eight days at most the hair will turn black.
If you are desirous of giving the hair a fine scent, moisten it with
Oil of Benjamin.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r17"></a>17. <i>Simple Means of producing the same Effect.</i></p>

<p>The Leaves of the Wild Vine change the hairs black, and prevent their
falling <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>off. Burnt Cork; Roots of the Holm-oak, and Caper-tree;
Barks of Willow, Walnut-tree and Pomegranate; Leaves of Artichoaks,
the Mulberry-tree, Fig-tree, Rasberry-bush Shells of Beans; Gall and
Cypress-nuts; Leaves of Myrtle; green Shells of Walnuts; Ivy-berries,
Cockle, and red Beet-seeds, Poppy-flowers, Alum, and most preparations
of Lead. These ingredients may be boiled in Rain-water, Wine or
Vinegar, with the addition of some cephalic Plant, as Sage, Marjoram,
Balm, Betony, Clove-july-flowers, Laurel, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r18"></a>18. <i>To change the Hair or Beard black.</i></p>

<p>Take Oil of Costus and Myrtle, of each an ounce and a half; mix them
well in a leaden mortar; adding liquid Pitch, expressed Juice of Walnut
Leaves and Laudanum, of each half an ounce; Gall-nuts, Black-lead, and
Frankincense, of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>each a drachm; and a sufficient quantity of Mucilage
of Gum Arabic made with a decoction of Gall Nuts.</p>

<p>Rub the head and chin with this mixture, after they have been shaved.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r19"></a>19. <i>A Fluid to die the Hair of a flaxen Colour.</i></p>

<p>Take a quart of Lye prepared from the Ashes of Vine Twigs; Briony,
Celandine Roots, and Turmeric, of each half an ounce; Saffron and Lily
Roots, of each two drachms; Flowers of Mullein, Yellow Stechas, Broom,
and St. John's-wort, of each a drachm; boil these ingredients together,
and strain off the Liquor clear.</p>

<p>Frequently wash the hair with this fluid, and in a little time it will
change to a beautiful flaxen colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r20"></a>20. <i>A perfumed Basket.</i></p>

<p>Place a layer of perfumed Cotton extremely thin and even on a piece of
Taffety stretched in a frame; strew on it some Violet Powder, and then
some Cypress Powder; cover the whole with another piece of Taffety:
nothing more remains to complete the work, but to quilt it, and cut it
of the size of the basket, trimming the edges with ribband.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r21"></a>21. <i>Natural Cosmetics.</i></p>

<p>The Juice that issues from the Birch-Tree, when wounded with an
auger in spring, is detersive and excellent to clear the complexion:
the same virtue is attributed to its distilled water. Some people
recommend Strawberry-water; others the decoction of Orpiment, and some
Frog-spawn-water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r22"></a>22. <i>A remedy for Corns on the Feet.</i></p>

<p>Roast a Clove of Garlic, or an Onion, on a live coal or in hot ashes;
apply it to the corn, and fasten it on with a piece of cloth. This
softens the corn to such a degree, as to loosen and wholly remove it
in two or three days. Foment the corn every other night in warm water,
after which renew the application.</p>

<p>The same intention will be yet more effectually answered by applying to
the corn a bit of the plaster of Diachylon with the Gums, spread on a
small piece of linen; removing it occasionally to foment the corn with
warm water, and pare off the softened part with a penknife.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r23"></a>23. <i>A Coral Stick for the Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Make a stiff Paste with Tooth Powder and a sufficient quantity of
Mucilage of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Gum Tragacanth: form with this Paste little cylindrical
Rollers, the thickness of a large goose quill, and about three inches
in length. Dry them in the shade. The method of using this stick is
to rub it against the teeth, which become cleaner in proportion as it
wastes.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r24"></a>24. <i>A receipt to clean the Teeth and Gums, and make the Flesh grow
close to the Root of the Enamel.</i></p>

<p>Take an ounce of Myrrh in fine powder, two spoonfuls of the best white
Honey, and a little green Sage in fine powder; mix them well together,
and rub the teeth and gums with a little of this Balsam every night and
morning.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r25"></a>25. <i>Ditto, to strengthen the Gums and fasten loose Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Dissolve an ounce of Myrrh as much as possible in half a pint of Red
Wine and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>same quantity of Oil of Almonds: Wash the mouth with this
fluid every morning.</p>

<p>This is also an excellent remedy against worms in the teeth.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r26"></a>26. <i>Another.</i></p>

<p>Dissolve a drachm of Cachoe (an Indian perfume) in a quart of Red Wine,
and use it for washing the mouth.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r27"></a>27. <i>Or rather.</i></p>

<p>Bruise Tobacco Roots in a mortar, and rub the teeth and gums with a
linen cloth dipped in the Juice. You may also put some Tobacco bruised
between the fingers into the hollow of the tooth. Or take the green
Leaves of a Plum-tree, or of Rosemary, and boil them in Lees of Wine or
Vinegar; gargle the mouth with the Wine as hot as you can bear it, and
repeat it frequently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r28"></a>28. <i>For rotten Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Make a balsam with a sufficient quantity of Honey, two scruples of
Myrrh in fine powder, a scruple of Gum Juniper, and ten grains of Roch
Alum. Frequently apply this mixture to the decayed tooth.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r29"></a>29. <i>A liquid Remedy for decayed Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Take a pint of the Juice of the Wild Gourd, a quarter of a pound of
Mulberry Bark, and Pellitory of Spain, each three ounces; Roch Alum,
Sal Gem, and Borax, of each half an ounce. Put these ingredients into
a glass vessel, and distill in a sand heat to dryness; take of this
liquor and Brandy, each an equal part, and wash the mouth with them
warm. This mixture removes all putridity, and cleanses away dead flesh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r30"></a>30. <i>A Powder to clean the Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Take Dragon's Blood and Cinnamon, of each one ounce and a half, Burnt
Alum, or Cream of Tartar, one ounce; beat all together into a very fine
powder, and rub a little on the teeth every other day.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r31"></a>31. <i>A Remedy for sore Gums and loose Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Boil Oak Leaves in spring-water, and add to the decoction a few drops
of Spirit of Sulphur. Gargle the mouth with a little of this liquor
every morning while necessary.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r32"></a>32. <i>An approved Receipt against that troublesome Complaint, called the
Teeth set on Edge.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Purslain, Sorrel, Sweet or Bitter Almonds, Walnuts, or burnt Bread,
chewed, will certainly remove this disagreeable sensation.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r33"></a>33. <i>A Liquid for cleansing the Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Take Lemon Juice, two ounces, Burnt Alum and Salt, of each six grains;
boil them together about a minute in a glazed pipkin, and then strain
through a linen cloth. The method of application is to wrap a bit of
clean rag round the end of a stick, dipping it in the Liquid, and rub
it gently against the teeth. You must be careful not to have too much
of the Liquid on the rag, for fear it should excoriate the gums or
inside of the mouth. This application ought not to be used above once
every two or three months.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r34"></a>34. <i>A sure Preservative from the Tooth Ache, and Defluxions on the
Gums or Teeth.</i></p>

<p>After having washed your mouth with water, as cleanliness and indeed
health requires, you should every morning rince the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>mouth with a tea
spoonful of Lavender-Water mixed with an equal quantity of warm or cold
water, whichever you like best, to diminish its activity. This simple
and innocent remedy is a certain preservative, the success of which has
been confirmed by long experience.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r35"></a>35. <i>A Method to make the Teeth beautifully white.</i></p>

<p>Take Gum Tragacanth, one ounce; Pumice-stone, two drachms; Gum Arabic,
half an ounce; and Crystals of Tartar, finely powdered, one ounce;
dissolve the Gums in Rose-water, and adding to it the powder, form the
whole into little sticks, which are to be dried slowly in the shade,
and afterwards kept for use.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r36"></a>36. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take dried Leaves of Hyssop, Wild Thyme, and Mint, of each half an
ounce; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Roch Alum, prepared Hartshorn, and Salt, of each a drachm;
calcine these ingredients together in a pot placed on burning coals;
when sufficiently calcined, add of Pepper and Mastic, each half a
drachm, and of Myrrh a scruple; reduce the whole into a fine powder,
and make them into a proper consistence with Storax dissolved in
Rose-water. Rub the teeth with a small bit of this Mixture every
morning, and afterwards wash the mouth with warm Wine.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r37"></a>37. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Dip a piece of clean rag in Vinegar of Squills, and rub the teeth and
gums with it. This not only whitens, but fastens and strengthens the
roots of the teeth, and corrects an offensive breath.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r38"></a>38. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take Rose-water, Syrup of Violets, clarified Honey, and Plantain-water,
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>each half an ounce; Spirit of Vitriol one ounce; mix them together.
Rub the teeth with a linen rag moistened in this Liquor, and then rince
the mouth with equal parts of Rose and Plantain-water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r39"></a>39. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Rub them well with Nettle or Tobacco Ashes, or rather with Vine Ashes
mixed with a little Honey.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r40"></a>40. <i>A Powder to cleanse the Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Take prepared Coral and Dragons-blood, of each an ounce; Cinnamon and
Cloves, of each six drachms; Cuttle-bone, and calcined Egg-shells,
of each half an ounce; Sea Salt decrepitated, a drachm, all in fine
powder: mix them in a marble mortar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r41"></a>41. <i>The following was communicated by Mr. Rae, Surgeon Dentist, in the
Adelphi, London.</i></p>

<p>Take of Cuttlefish-bone, and the finest prepared Chalk, each half an
ounce; Peruvian Bark, and Florentine Iris Root, each two drachms:
reduce the whole into a fine Powder, and mix them. This may be coloured
with a little Rose Pink, and scented with a few drops of Oil of
Cinnamon.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r42"></a>42. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take Pumice-stone prepared, Sealed Earth, and Red Coral prepared, of
each an ounce; Dragons-blood, half an ounce; Cream of Tartar, an ounce
and a half; Cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce; and Cloves, a scruple:
beat the whole together into a Powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>This Powder serves to cleanse, whiten, and preserve the Teeth; and
prevents the accidents that arise from the collection of Tartar or any
other foulness about them.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r43"></a>43. <i>An efficacious Tooth-Powder.</i></p>

<p>Take Myrrh, Roch Allum, Dragon's Blood, and Cream of Tartar, of each
half an ounce; Musk, two grains; and make them into a very fine powder.
This, though simple, is an efficacious dentifrice; but nothing of this
kind should be applied too frequently to the teeth for fear of hurting
the enamel.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r44"></a>44. <i>A Powder to cleanse the Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Take Pumice-Stone and Cuttle-fish Bone, of each half an ounce; Tartar
vitriolated, and Mastich, of each a drachm; Oil of Rhodium four drops:
mix all into a fine powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r45"></a>45. <i>A Tincture to strengthen the Gums and prevent the Scurvy.</i></p>

<p>Take an ounce of Peruvian Bark grossly powdered, infuse it a fortnight
or longer in half a pint of Brandy. Gargle the mouth every night or
morning, with a tea spoonful of this Tincture diluted with an equal
quantity of Rose-water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r46"></a>46. <i>Manner of preparing the Roots for cleaning the Teeth, according to
Mr. Baum&egrave;.</i></p>

<p>The roots that are used to clean the teeth are formed at both ends
like little brushes; and in all probability were substituted in the
room of Tooth-brushes, on account of their being softer to the gums
and more convenient. They are used in the following manner; one of the
ends is moistened with a little water, dipped into the Tooth-Powder,
and then rubbed against <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>the teeth till they look white. Fibrous and
woody Roots are best formed into little brushes, and on this account
deserve a preference to others. The Roots are deprived of their juicy
parts by boiling them several times in a large quantity of fresh Water.
When Lucern Roots are used, those of two years growth are chosen, about
the thickness of one's little finger; such as are thicker, unsound or
worm-eaten, being rejected. They are cut into pieces about six inches
long, and, as we have just observed, are boiled in water till all
the juicy parts are extracted. Being then taken out, they are left
to drain; after which each end of the roots is slit with a penknife
into the form of a little brush, and they are slowly dried to prevent
their splitting. In the same manner are prepared Liquorice Roots.
Marsh-mallow Roots are prepared in an easier way; but, on account of
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>mucilage they contain, they become very brittle when dry. Such as
are large and very even are made choice of, and rasped with a knife to
remove the outer bark. They are dyed red by infusing them in the
same dye as is used to colour spunges. When the Roots have remained
twenty-four hours in the dye, they are taken out, slowly dried,
and varnished with two or three coats of a strong Mucilage of Gum
Tragacanth, each being suffered to dry before another is laid on. The
whole is afterwards repeatedly anointed with Friars Balsam, in order to
form a varnish less susceptible of moisture.</p>

<p>Lucern and Liquorice Roots are dyed and varnished in the same manner:
those of Marsh-mallows, from the loss of their Mucilage, considerably
diminish in thickness during the time they stand in infusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r47"></a>47. <i>Manner of preparing Sponges for the Teeth</i></p>

<p>For this purpose very thin sponges are made choice of, which are
to be washed in several waters; squeezing them with the hands, to
loosen and force away the little shells that adhere to their internal
surface. Being afterwards dried, they are neatly cut into the shape of
balls about the size of small eggs; and when they have undergone this
preparation, they are dyed in the following manner.</p>

<p>Take Brazil Wood rasped, four ounces; Cochineal bruised, three
drachms; Roch Alum, half an ounce; Water, four pints: put them into a
proper vessel, and boil till one half of the Liquor is consumed. Then
strain the decoction through a piece of linen, and pour it hot upon
the sponges, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>which are to be left in infusion twelve hours; at the
expiration of which time, they are to be repeatedly washed in fresh
water, as long as any colour proceeds from them. Being dried, they are
afterwards dipped in Spirit of Wine, aromatized with Essential Oil of
Cinnamon, Cloves, Lavender, &amp;c. The sponges are then fit for use, and
when dried by squeezing, are kept in a wide-mouthed glass-bottle well
corked.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r48"></a>48. <i>Rules for the Preservation of the Teeth and Gums.</i></p>

<p>The teeth are bones thinly covered with a fine enamel, which is more or
less strong in different persons. When this enamel is wasted, either by
a scorbutic humour or any external cause, the tooth cannot long remain
sound, and must therefore be cleaned, but with great caution. For this
pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>pose the best instrument is a small piece of wood, like a butcher's
skewer, rendered soft at the end. It is generally to be used alone;
only once in a fortnight dip it into a few grains of gunpowder, which
has previously been bruised. This will remove every spot and blemish,
and give your Teeth an inconceivable whiteness. It is almost needless
to say, that the mouth must be well washed after this operation; for
besides the necessity of so doing, the salt-petre, &amp;c. used in the
composition of Gunpowder, would, if it remained, prove injurious to the
gums, &amp;c. but has not, nor can have, any bad effect in so short a time.</p>

<p>It is necessary to observe, that very near the gums of people whose
teeth are otherwise good, there is apt to grow a crust, both within and
without, which, if neglected, separates the gums from the fangs <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>of the
teeth; and the latter being by this means left bare, are frequently
destroyed. This crust must therefore be carefully scraped off.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r49"></a>49. <i>For stopping the Decay of Teeth.</i></p>

<p>Take of Bole Armenian the quantity of a large nutmeg, a like quantity
of Roch Alum, two penny-worth of Cochineal bruised, and a small handful
of the Chips of Lignum Vitæ; simmer them with four ounces of Honey in a
new pipkin, for a little time, well stirring them all the while, till
the ingredients are mixed. In using it, take a large skewer, on the end
of which is tied a piece of linen rag; dip the rag in the medicine, and
rub the teeth and gums with it. The longer you abstain from spitting,
after the use of the remedy, the better. Wash the mouth well at least
once every day, particularly after meals, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>first rubbing the teeth
with salt upon the end of your finger. Teeth much decayed, or useless,
should be drawn, if the operation can be performed with safety.</p>

<p>The reader will find several other receipts for the Teeth, under the
article of Waters.</p>

<h2><a name="WATERS" id="WATERS">WATERS.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r50"></a>50. <i>The Celestial Water.</i></p>

<p>Take the best Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Ginger, Zedoary, Galangals, and
White-Pepper, of each an ounce; six Lemon-peels, pared thin; two
handfuls of Damascene Grapes; as much Jujebs; a handful of Pith
of Dwarf-Elder; four handfuls of Juniper-berries perfectly ripe;
Fennel-Seeds, Flowers of Sweet Basil, St. John's-wort, Rosemary,
Marjoram, Pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>nyroyal, Stechas, Musk Roses, Rue, Scabious, Centaury,
Fumitory, and Agrimony, of each a handful; Spikenard, Aloes-Wood,
Grains of Paradise, Calamus Aromaticus, Mace, Gum Olibanum, and Yellow
Sanders, of each two ounces; Hepatic Aloes, fine Amber and Rhubarb,
of each two drachms. All these drugs being procured good in their
kind, beat in a mortar those that ought to be pulverized, and put the
whole, thoroughly mixed together, into a large strong glass alembic;
pouring as much genuine brandy upon them as will rise at least three
fingers breadth above the ingredients. Then having well closed the
mouth of the alembic, bury the vessel fifteen days in warm horse-dung,
and afterwards distil the Tincture in balneo Mariæ, the water almost
boiling hot. When you perceive the water in the receiver change its
colour, instantly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>stop the process, and separate the phlegm from
the spirit, by another distillation conducted in the same manner.
The liquor thus obtained is the genuine Celestial Water. <i>Note</i>,
when you perceive this second water begin to lose its transparency,
and incline to a reddish colour, put it by in a strong glass bottle
closely stopped, and dissolve in the residue half a pound of the best
Treacle, with as much Venice Turpentine and fresh Oil of Almonds. Place
the alembic in a sand heat, and urge the fire to the first degree, to
have the genuine Balsamic Oil, which ought to be of the consistence of
clarified Honey.</p>

<p>If a person rubs himself in the morning with this water on the
forehead, eyelids, back of the head, and nape of the neck, it renders
him quick and easy of conception, strengthens the memory, enlivens the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>spirits, and greatly comforts the sight. By putting a few drops with
a bit of cotton up the nostrils, it becomes a sovereign cephalic, and
cleanses the brain of all superfluous cold and catarrhal humours. If a
table spoonful is drank every third day, it tends to preserve the body
in vigour. It is an excellent remedy against asthmatic complaints, and
corrects an offensive breath.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r51"></a>51. <i>A Receipt to make the genuine Hungary-Water.</i></p>

<p>Put into an alembic a pound and a half of fresh pickt Rosemary Flowers;
Pennyroyal and Marjoram Flowers, of each half a pound; three quarts
of good Coniac Brandy; having close stopped the mouth of the alembic
to prevent the Spirit from evaporating, bury it twenty-eight hours in
horse-dung to digest, and then distil off the Spirit in a water-bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>A drachm of Hungary-Water diluted with Spring-Water, may be taken
once or twice a week in the morning fasting. It is also used by way
of embrocation to bathe the face and limbs, or any part affected
with pains, or debility. This remedy recruits the strength, dispells
gloominess and strengthens the sight. It must always be used cold,
whether taken inwardly as a medicine, or applied externally.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r52"></a>52. <i>Another Receipt to make Hungary-Water.</i></p>

<p>Fill a glass or stone cucurbit half full of fresh gathered
Rosemary-tops picked in their prime; pour on them as much Spirit of
Wine as will thoroughly soak them. Put the vessel in a water-bath,
and having closely luted on the head and receiver, leave it to digest
on a gentle <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>fire for three days; at the expiration of which period
unlute the vessel, and pour back into the cucurbit whatever liquor
you find in the receiver. Then lute your cucurbit again, and encrease
the fire so as to cause the Spirit to rise fast over the helm. When
about two thirds of the liquor are drawn off, remove the fire, and let
the vessel stand to cool; you will find in the receiver an excellent
Hungary-Water, which is to be kept in a glass bottle closely stopped.
Hungary-water must be drawn off with a brisk fire, or the Spirit of
Wine will come over the helm, very little impregnated with the essence
of Rosemary.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r53"></a>53. <i>Directions for making Lavender-Water.</i></p>

<p>Fill a glass or earthen body two thirds full of Lavender Flowers and
then fill up the vessel with Brandy or Melasses <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Spirits. Let the
Flowers stand in infusion eight days, or less if straitened for time;
then distil off the Spirit, in a water-bath with a brisk fire, at first
in large drops or even a small stream, that the Essential Oil of the
Flowers may rise with the Spirit. But as this cannot be done without
the phlegm coming over the helm at the same time, the Spirit must be
rectified. The first distillation being finished, unlute the still,
throw away what remains in the body, and, fill it with fresh Flowers
of Lavender, in the proportion of two pounds of Lavender Flowers to
one pint of Spirit; pour the Spirit already distilled according to the
foregoing directions, on the Lavender Flowers, and distil a second time
in a vapour-bath.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r54"></a>54. <i>Another Method.</i></p>

<p>Take fresh or dried Lavender Flowers, sprinkle them with White Wine,
Brandy, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>Melasses Spirit, or Rose-water; let them stand in infusion for
some days, and then distil off the Spirit. The distilled water will be
more odoriferous, if the Flowers are dried in the sun in a glass bottle
close stopped, and White Wine afterwards poured upon them.</p>

<p>If you would have speedily, without the trouble of distillation, a
water impregnated with the flavour of Lavender, put two or three drops
of Oil of Spike, and a lump of Sugar, into a pint of clear Water, or
Spirit of Wine, and shake them well together in a glass phial, with a
narrow neck. This Water, though not distilled, is very fragrant.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r55"></a>55. <i>To make Rose-Water.</i></p>

<p>To make an excellent Rose-water, let the Flowers be gathered two or
three <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>hours after sun-rising in very fine weather; beat them in a
marble mortar into a paste, and leave them in the mortar soaking in
their juice, for five or six hours; then put the mass into a coarse
canvas bag, and press out the Juice; to every quart of which add
a pound of fresh Damask Roses, and let them stand in infusion for
twenty-four hours. Then put the whole into a glass alembic, lute on
a head and receiver, and place it on a sand heat. Distil at first
with a gentle fire, which is to be encreased gradually till the drops
follow each other as quick as possible; draw off the water as long as
it continues to run clear, then put out the fire, and let the alembic
stand till cold. The distilled water at first will have very little
fragrancy, but after being exposed to the heat of the sun about eight
days, in a bottle lightly stopped with a bit of paper, it acquires an
admirable scent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p class="plabel"><a id="r56"></a>56. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Infuse in ten or twenty pints of Juice of Damask Roses, expressed in
the manner above described, a proportionable quantity of Damask Rose
Leaves gathered with the usual precautions. After standing in infusion
twenty-four hours, pour the whole into a short-necked alembic, distil
in a sand heat, and draw off as much as possible, taking care not to
leave the residuum quite dry, for fear the distilled water should have
an empyreumatic or still-burnt flavour. After emptying the alembic,
pour the distilled water a second time into it, and add a good quantity
of fresh picked Damask Roses. Lute it well, placing it again in a sand
heat, and repeat the distillation. But content yourself this time with
a little more than half the water you put back into the alembic. To
impress on Rose-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>water the utmost degree of fragrancy of which it is
susceptible, it is necessary to expose it to the genial warmth of the
sun.</p>

<p>Rose-water is an excellent lotion for the eyes, if used every morning,
and makes a part in all collyriums prescribed for inflammations of
these parts; it is also proper in many other complaints.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r57"></a>57. <i>To make Orange-Flower Water.</i></p>

<p>Having gathered (two hours before sun-rise, in fine weather) a quantity
of Orange-Flowers, pluck them leaf by leaf, and throw away the stalks
and stems: fill a tin cucurbit two thirds full of these picked Flowers;
lute on a low bolt-head, not above two inches higher than the cucurbit;
place it in balneo Mariæ, or a water-bath, and distill with a strong
fire. You run no risk from pressing forward the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>distillation with
violence, the water-bath effectually preventing the Flowers from being
burnt. In this method you pay no regard to the quantity, but the
quality of the water drawn off. If nine pounds of Orange Flowers were
put into the still, be satisfied with three or four quarts of fragrant
water; however, you may continue your distillation, and save even the
last droppings of the still, which have some small fragrancy. During
the operation, be careful to change the water in the refrigeratory
vessel as often as it becomes hot. Its being kept cool prevents the
distilled water from having an empyreumatic or burnt smell, and keeps
the quintessence of the Flowers more intimately united with its phlegm.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r58"></a>58. <i>Another Method.</i></p>

<p>Take four pounds of unpicked Orange Flowers, bruise them in a marble
mortar, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>and pour on them nine quarts of clear Water. Distil in a cold
still, and draw off five or six quarts, which will be exquisitely
fragrant. If you are desirous of having it still higher flavoured, draw
off at first full seven quarts, unlute the still and throw away the
residuum; empty back the water already distilled, and add to it two
pounds of fresh Orange Flowers bruised. Again luting the still, repeat
the distillation, and draw of five or six quarts. Then stop, being
careful not to draw off too much water, lest the Flowers should become
dry and burn too.</p>

<p>The use of Orange-Flower Water is very extensive. It is high in esteem
for its aromatic perfume; and is used with success for hysteric
complaints.</p>

<p>Waters from all kinds of Flowers are made in the same manner as
Orange-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Flower and Rose-water; but waters from dried odoriferous
plants, such as Thyme, Hyssop, Marjoram and Wormwood, are made as
follows.</p>

<p>Fill two thirds of a large stone jar with the tops of the plant you
propose to distil; boil, in a sufficient quantity of water, some
twigs or tops of the same plant; and when one half of the water has
evaporated, pour the remainder into a jar over the flowers, and let
them stand to infuse three or four days; then distil them in a common
or cold still. Care, however, must be taken not to distil to dryness,
lest you risque the bottom of the vessel; to prevent which accident,
the best way is never to draw off more than two thirds of the liquor
put into the still. If you be desirous that the distilled water should
acquire a higher flavour, after the first distillation unlute the
still, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>throw out what remains at the bottom, and fill it half full of
fresh tops of the plant, pouring on them the water already distilled;
repeat the distillation, and this second time the water drawn off
will be highly odoriferous. If the plant contains a large portion of
Essential Oil, it will not fail to float on the top of the liquor
contained in the receiver, and may be separated by the usual method.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r59"></a>59. <i>Magisterial Balm-Water.</i></p>

<p>Take half a pound of Cinnamon, six ounces of Cardamon-seeds, and the
same quantity of green Aniseeds; Cloves, four ounces; Coriander-seeds,
eight ounces: beat these spices in a marble mortar, and putting them
afterwards into a stone jar, add the Yellow Rind of eight Lemons, a
pound of Juniper-berries bruised, twelve handfuls of Balm gathered in
its prime, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>six handfuls of Rosemary-tops, as much Sage, Hyssop, and
Angelica, Sweet Marjoram and Thyme, of each six handfuls; Wormwood a
handful; cut the herbs very small, putting them into the jar with the
spices, and pour on four gallons of Brandy or Melasses Spirits. When
they have stood in infusion eight days, empty the ingredients and
liquor into an alembic of a common height, and distil in a water-bath.
At first draw off ten quarts, which are to be thrown again into the
alembic, continue the same degree of fire for some time, then gradually
lessen it till the aromatic spirit comes off in quick drops. Continue
your distillation in this manner till you perceived the phlegm rise,
which is easily known by the weakness of the Spirit, and when the
process is ended, expose the aromatic spirit which has been drawn off
to the rays of the sun, in a glass bottle, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>stopped only with a loose
paper cork, to give the fiery particles an opportunity of evaporating.
What remains in the body of the still is not to be considered as wholly
useless. After evaporating it to dryness, burn the residuum of the
plants and aromatics; and when the whole mass is reduced to ashes,
throw them into a vessel of boiling water, in which let them remain two
or three minutes on the fire. Then remove the vessel, and let the water
stand till cold, when it is to be filtered through blotting paper: The
water, which appears limpid, is to be set on the fire again, and
wholly evaporated. At the bottom of the vessel, which ought to be a
new-glazed earthen pot, will remain a pure white fixed salt, which may
be dissolved in the Magisterial Balm-water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>This water is highly esteemed, and has even acquired a reputation
equal to that of Hungary-water, (the receipt for preparing which has
been already given) and in particular cases is preferable.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r60"></a>60. <i>Compound Balm-Water, commonly called Eau de Carmes.</i></p>

<p>Take of the fresh Leaves of Balm, a quarter of a pound; Yellow Rind of
Lemons, two ounces; Nutmegs and Coriander-seeds, of each one ounce;
Cloves, Cinnamon, and Angelica Root, of each half an ounce: having
pounded the spices and seeds; and bruised the leaves and roots, put
them with a quart of Brandy into a glass cucurbit, of which stop the
mouth, and set it in a warm place, where let it remain two or three
days. Then add a pint of simple Balm-water, and shake the whole well
together; after <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>which distil in a vapour bath till the ingredients are
left almost dry; and preserve the water thus obtained, in bottles well
stopped.</p>

<p>This water has been long famous at Paris and London, and carried thence
to most parts of Europe. It has the reputation of being a cordial of
very extraordinary virtues, and not only of availing in all lowness of
spirits, but even in apoplexies. It is also much esteemed in cases of
the gout in the stomach; whence the Carmelite Friars, who originally
were in possession of the secret, have reaped great benefit from the
sale of this water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r61"></a>61. <i>Sweet Honey-Water.</i></p>

<p>Take of good French Brandy, a gallon; of the best Virgin Honey and
Coriander-seeds, each a pound; Cloves, an ounce <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>and half; Nutmegs, an
ounce; Gum Benjamin and Storax, of each an ounce; Vanilloes No. 4; the
Yellow Rind of three large Lemons: bruise the Spices and Benjamin, cut
the Vanilloes into small pieces, put all into a cucurbit, and pour the
Brandy on them. After they have digested forty-eight hours, distil off
the Spirit in a retort with a gentle heat.</p>

<p>To a gallon of this water, add of Damask Rose-water and Orange
Flower-water, of each a pint and a half; Musk and Ambergrise, of each
five grains; first grind the Musk and Ambergrise with some of the
water, and afterwards put all into a large matrass, shake them well
together, and let them circulate three days and nights in a gentle
heat. Then, letting the water cool, filtre and keep it for use, in a
bottle well stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an antiparalytic, smooths the skin, and gives one of the most
agreeable scents imaginable. Forty or sixty drops put into a pint of
clear water, are sufficient to wash the hands and face.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r62"></a>62. <i>Sweet-scented Water.</i></p>

<p>Take Orange Flower-water and Rose-water, of each an equal quantity; put
them into a large wide-mouthed glass, and strew upon the surface gently
as much Jasmine Flowers as will cover it; then tie the mouth of the
glass so carefully that the Flowers be not shook down to the bottom.
Repeat the process, letting each quantity of the Flowers remain five or
six days, until the water is strongly scented with them. Then dissolve
Ambergrise and Musk, of each a scruple, in a few ounces of the water,
which filtre and put to the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>This water may also be made by putting the whole into a retort with a
sufficient quantity of Jasmine Flowers, and drawing it off in a vapour
bath into a receiver well luted.</p>

<p>This is an excellent perfume, and taken inwardly, is of service in some
nervous cases and languors.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r63"></a>63. <i>German sweet-scented Water.</i></p>

<p>Begin with infusing for eight days in two quarts of Vinegar, two
handfuls of Lavender Flowers, as many Provence Roses picked from the
stalks, Wild Roses, and Elder Flowers. While they stand in infusion
prepare a simple odoriferous water as follows: Put into a glass body
the Yellow Rind of three Lemons, sweet Marjoram, Lilies of the Valley
and Lavender Flowers, of each two handfuls; pour on them <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>a pint of
double distilled Rose-water, and a quart of Spring-water. Lute on a
bolt-head, place the alembic in a sand heat, fix on a receiver, and
leave matters in this state two days, then light a fire under it and
distil quick. When you have drawn off a quart, stop your distillation,
and keep this simple odoriferous water for the following use.</p>

<p>Take wild Thyme, sweet Marjoram, sweet Basil, and Thyme, of each a
handful; Florentine Orrice and Cinnamon, of each half an ounce; Cloves,
Mace, purified Storax, and Benjamin, of each three drachms; Labdanum,
two drachms; Aspalathum, half an ounce; Socotrine Aloes, half a drachm;
put all these ingredients, thoroughly bruised, into a stone jar, and
add to them the Vinegar infusion, the distilled odoriferous water,
and a quart <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>of Frontiniac, Mountain, or Cowslip Wine. Stir them well
together, and leave the whole to digest for fifteen days, at the
expiration of which time, empty the infusion into a glass body, large
enough to contain a sixth part more liquor; lute on the head, place
it in a sand heat, and begin your distillation with a very gentle
fire, increasing it gradually. It sometimes happens that the phlegm of
the Vinegar comes over the helm first; when that is the case, set it
aside as useless. As soon as the Spirit begins to rise, which you will
directly perceive by its aromatic flavour, fix a receiver on the beak
of the alembic, and distil off about three pints. Keep this by itself
as the most spirituous part of your preparation; and continue to draw
off the remainder as long as it runs clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The German sweet-scented Water is penetrating and incisive, admirably
revives the vital spirits, removes headaches, comforts the heart, is
excellent against unwholesome air, and of course a preservative from
contagion.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r64"></a>64. <i>Imperial Water.</i></p>

<p>Take five quarts of Brandy, in which dissolve an ounce of Frankincense,
Mastic, Benjamin, and Gum Arabic; add half an ounce of Cloves and
Nutmegs; an ounce and a half of Pine-nut Kernels, and sweet Almonds;
with three grains of Musk. Bruise these ingredients in a marble mortar,
distil in a vapour bath, and keep the water that is drawn off in a
glass bottle, close stopped.</p>

<p>This water takes away wrinkles, and renders the skin extremely
delicate; it also <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>whitens the Teeth, and abates the tooth-ache,
sweetens the breath, and strengthens the gums. Foreign ladies prize it
highly.</p>

<p>Take sweet Basil, Mint, sweet Marjoram, Florentine Orrice-root, Hyssop,
Balm, Savory, Lavender, and Rosemary, of each a handful; Cloves,
Cinnamon, and Nutmegs, of each half an ounce; three or four Lemons,
cut in thick slices; infuse them three days in a good quantity of
Rose-water; distil in a water bath with a gentle fire, and add to the

<p class="plabel"><a id="r66"></a>66. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take sweet Marjoram, Thyme, Lavender, Rosemary, Pennyroyal-buds, red
Roses, Violet-flowers, Clove-july-flowers, Savory, and Orange-peels,
of each equal <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>parts; infuse in White Wine till they entirely sink to
the bottom of the Wine; then distil in an alembic, two or three times.
Keep the Water in bottles well corked; and preserve the residuum as a
perfume.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r67"></a>67. <i>The Ladies Water.</i></p>

<p>Take two handfuls and a half of Red Roses; Rosemary Flowers, Lavender,
and Spikenard, of each a handful; Thyme, Chamomile Flowers, Sage of
Virtue, Pennyroyal, and Marjoram, of each a handful; infuse in White
Wine twenty-four hours; then put the whole into an alembic; sprinkle it

and a half of choice Cloves, Gum Benjamin, and Storax, strained, each

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p class="plabel"><a id="r68"></a>68. <i>A beautifying Wash.</i></p>

<p>Take equal parts of White Tansey, and Rhubarb Water, and to every half
pint add two drachms of Sal Ammoniac.</p>

<p>This fluid is applied with a feather or hair pencil, three or four
times a day, to pimples or tetters, on any part of the body.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r69"></a>69. <i>A Cosmetic Water.</i></p>

<p>Wash the face with the tears that issue from the Vine, during the
months of May and June.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r70"></a>70. <i>An Excellent Cosmetic.</i></p>

<p>Pimpernel Water is so sovereign a beautifier of the complexion, that it
ought always to have a place on a Lady's toilet.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p class="plabel"><a id="r71"></a>71. <i>Venice Water, highly esteemed.</i></p>

<p>In the month of May, take two quarts of Cow's Milk, which pour into
a bottle with eight Lemons and four Oranges, sliced; add an ounce of
Sugar Candy, and half an ounce of Borax; distil in a water bath or sand
heat.</p>

<p>This water is counterfeited at Bagdat in Persia, in the following
manner. Take twelve Lemons peeled and sliced, twelve new-laid Eggs, six
Sheeps Trotters, four ounces of Sugar Candy, a large slice of Melon,
and another of Pompion, with two drachms of Borax; distil in a large
glass alembic with a leaden head.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r72"></a>72. <i>A Balsamic Water.</i></p>

<p>Take a pound of Venice Turpentine; Oil of Bays, Galbanum, Gum Arabic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Ivy Gum, Frankincense, Myrrh, Hepatic Aloes, Aloes-wood, Galangals,
Cloves, Comfrey, Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Zedoary, Ginger, and White Dittany,
each three ounces; Borax, four ounces; Musk, a drachm; Ambergrise, a
scruple; after bruising such of the ingredients as are capable of being
powdered, infuse the whole in six quarts of Brandy; and distil it. The
Balsamic Water drawn off will be good to strengthen the limbs, and
cause that beauty and vigour which so much delights the eye.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r73"></a>73. <i>Angelic Water, of a most agreeable Scent.</i></p>

<p>Put into a large alembic the following ingredients, Benjamin, four
ounces; Storax, two ounces; Yellow Sanders, an ounce; Cloves, two
drachms; two or three bits of Florentine Orrice, half the Peel of
a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Lemon, two Nutmegs, half an ounce of Cinnamon, two quarts of
Rose-water, a pint of Orange Flower-water, and a pint of Magisterial
Balm-water. Put the whole into an alembic well luted; distil in a water
bath; and what you draw off will prove an exquisite Angelic Water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r74"></a>74. <i>Nosegay or Toilet Water.</i></p>

<p>Take Honey-water, an ounce; Eau sans Pareille, two ounces;
Jasmine-water, not quite five drachms; Clove-water, and Violet-water,
of each half an ounce; Cyprus-water, sweet Calamus-water, and
Lavender-water, of each two drachms; Spirit of Neroli or Oranges ten
drops; mix all these Waters together, and keep the mixture in a vial
close corked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>This water has a delightful scent; but its use is only for the toilet.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r75"></a>75. <i>Spirit of Guaiacum.</i></p>

<p>Spirit of Guaiacum is prepared by infusing two ounces of Guaiacum
Shavings in a quart of Brandy, ten or twelve days, shaking the vessel
now and then. The Tincture is then filtred through paper, and used to
gargle the mouth in the same manner as the Vulnerary-water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r76"></a>76. <i>The Divine Cordial.</i></p>

<p>To make this, take, in the beginning of the month of March, two ounces
of the Roots of the true Acorus, Betony, Florentine Orrice-roots,
Cyprus, Gentian, and sweet Scabious; an ounce of Cinnamon, and as much
Yellow Sanders; two drachms of Mace; an ounce of Juniper-berries; and
six drachms of Coriander-seeds; beat these ingredients, in a mortar,
to a coarse powder, and add thereto the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>outer Peel of six fine China
Oranges; put them all into a large vessel, with a gallon and a half
of Spirit of Wine; shake them well, and then cork the vessel tight
till the season for Flowers. When these are in full vigour, add half
a handful of the following: viz. Violets, Hyacinths, Jonquils, Wall
Flowers, Red, Damask, White, and Musk Roses, Clove-july-flowers, Orange
Flowers, Jasmine, Tuberoses, Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, Lavender, sweet
Marjoram, Broom, Elder, St. John's-wort, Marigold, Chamomile, Lilies of
the Valley, Narcissuses, Honeysuckle, Borage, and Bugloss.</p>

<p>Three seasons are required to procure all these Flowers in perfection;
Spring, Summer, and Autumn. Every time you gather any of these Flowers,
add them immediately to the infusion, mixing them <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>thoroughly with
the other ingredients; and three days after you have put in the
last Flowers, put the whole into a glass cucurbit, lute on the head
carefully, place it in a water bath over a slow fire, keep the receiver
cool, and draw off five quarts of Spirit, which will prove of a rare
quality. As a medicine, it is far more efficacious than Balm-water; and
for its fine scent, one of the best perfumes.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r77"></a>77. <i>Compound Cyprus Water.</i></p>

<p>Take a gallon of Spirit of Jasmine, infuse in it half an ounce of
Florentine Orrice grossly powdered, a quarter of an ounce of bruised
Angelica-seeds, three scraped Nutmegs, three ounces of White Musk-roses
bruised, a drachm of Spirit of Orange, and fifteen drops of Essence
of Ambergrise. If it is not the season for Roses, when you make this
Water, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>put instead of them a pint of Rose-water scented with Musk,
and if that cannot be procured, use common Rose-water; draw off the
Spirit in a water bath, and in a stream like a thread; taking care to
place the receiver in cold water, that the Spirit may cool as fast as
possible and thereby the better preserve its perfume.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r78"></a>78. <i>Imperial Water.</i></p>

<p>Put into a gallon of Brandy, a quarter of a pound of picked Violets,
an ounce of Florentine Orrice, a quarter of a pound of Double
Jonquils, two ounces of picked Orange Flowers, two Ounces of White
Musk-roses, three ounces of Tuberoses, a drachm of Mace, half a drachm
of Cloves, an ounce of Quintessence of Bergamot, and an ounce of
Quintessence of Oranges. All the Flowers must be gathered in their
proper season. Observe to put <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>into the Brandy at the same time with
the Violets, the Orrice, Mace, and Cloves, in gross powder, then add
the different Flowers as they come in season, remembering not to add
the quintessences, till after the Tuberoses, which are the last Flower.
Every time you put in a fresh Flower, shake the vessel, and cork it
very tight. Eight days after the Tuberoses have been infused, put the
whole into a glass body, lute on the head carefully, and place under
the receiver an earthen vessel filled with cold water, that the Spirit
may cool as fast as it comes over, by which means its scent will be the
better preserved. You may draw off two quarts of a rectified Spirit,
that will give perfect satisfaction to the most delicate judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p class="plabel"><a id="r79"></a>79. <i>All Flower Water.</i></p>

<p>Pour into a large vessel five quarts of strong Spirit of Wine, and
infuse in it the following Flowers, as they come in season: Violets,
Hyacinths, and Wall Flowers, of each a quarter of a pound; single and
double Jonquils, of each two ounces; a quarter of a pound of Lilies of
the Valley, and the same quantity of Spanish Jasmine; half an ounce
of Rosemary Flowers; an ounce of Elder Flowers; two ounces of Wild,
Damask, and White Roses, bruised; three ounces of Orange Flowers; a
quarter of a pound of Clove-july-flowers, Syringo Blossoms, Tuberoses,
and Tops of Mint in Flower; and thirty drops of Quintessence of
Musk-seed. The latter, however, need not be added till the time of
distillation, which must not be till three days after the last Flowers
have been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>fused. Perform the operation in a water bath, and having
carefully luted the head and receiver, which must be placed in a tub
of cold water, to preserve the scent, draw off about three quarts and
a pint with a moderate fire, then change the receiver, fix on another,
and draw off another pint, which, though of an inferior quality, is
well worth preserving.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r80"></a>80. <i>A curious Water, known by the Name of the Spring Nosegay.</i></p>

<p>Take six ounces of Hyacinths, a quarter of a pound of picked Violets,
the same quantity of Wall Flowers picked, and Jonquils; an ounce of
Florentine Orrice bruised; half an ounce of Mace grossly powdered; and
two ounces of Quintessense of Orange. Put the whole (the Jonquils, Wall
Flowers, and Lilies of the Valley excepted) about the end of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>March,
into a glass body, with a gallon of strong Spirit of Wine; bruise the
Hyacinths, Violets, Orrice, and Mace; and towards the end of April,
add the Jonquils, when in their perfection, that is to say, when full
blown. A few days after, put in the Wall Flowers, the Petals only;
then add the Lilies of the Valley, carefully picked, and shake all the
ingredients well: Eight days after having put in this last Flower,
empty the infusion into an alembic, lute on a head and receiver, which
must be placed in cold water, and distil in a water bath, with a gentle
fire. From the above quantity three quarts of excellent Spirit may be
drawn off, that justly deserves the appellation of the Spring Nosegay.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p class="plabel"><a id="r81"></a>81. <i>A Cosmetic Water, of great Use to prevent Pits after the
Small-Pox.</i></p>

<p>Dissolve an ounce and a half of Salt in a pint of Mint-water; boil
them together, and skim the Liquor. This is a very useful Wash for the
face after the Small-Pox, in order to clear away the scabs, allay the
itching, and remove the redness.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r82"></a>82. <i>A Cooling Wash.</i></p>

<p>Infuse in a sufficient quantity of clear Water, some Bran, Yolks of
Eggs, and a grain or two of Ambergrise, for three or four hours; then
distil the Water, which will prove an excellent Cosmetic, and clear the
skin surprisingly. It is of service to keep it in the sun eight or ten
days, in a bottle well corked.</p>

<p>The distilled Waters of Melons, Bean Flowers, the Wild-Vine, green or
unripe <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Barley, and the Water that is found in vesicles on the leaves

<p>Take two quarts of Water, in which a quantity of Horse-beans has been
boiled till quite soft; put it into an alembic, and add two handfuls
of Pimpernel, the same quantity of White Tansy, a pound of Veal minced
small, six new-laid Eggs, and a pint of White-Wine Vinegar; distil
this mixture in a water-bath, and it will afford an excellent Lotion
to remove all eruptions on the face, if washed with it every night and
morning.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r84"></a>84. <i>Another.</i></p>

<p>Knead a Loaf with three pounds of Wheaten Flour, a pound of Bean Flour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>and Goats Milk, with Mild Yeast or Leaven. Bake it in an oven, scoop
out the crumb, and soak it thoroughly in new Goats Milk and six Whites
of Eggs; add an ounce of calcined Egg-shells. Mix all well together,
and distil in a sand heat. You will obtain an excellent cosmetic water,
by washing with which every day, the face will become smooth and clear.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r85"></a>85. <i>Venetian Water to clear a Sun-burnt Complexion.</i></p>

<p>Take a pint of Cow's Milk, or, in the month of May, a pint of the Water
that distils from the Vine when wounded, eight Lemons and four Seville
Oranges cut in thin slices, two ounces of Sugar Candy, half an ounce
of Borax in fine powder, and four Narcissus Roots beaten to a paste;
distil these ingredients in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>vapour-bath. Rectify the distilled
Liquor by the same method, and keep it in a bottle closely corked.</p>

of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Cow's Milk, and the crumb of a Wheaten Loaf; distil in a glass
alembic. The distilled Water, for use, must be mixed with an equal
quantity of Hungary Water: it then admirably clears the complexion.</p>

<p>The distilled Waters of Fennel, and White Lilies, with a little Gum
Mastic, will produce the same effect.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r89"></a>89. <i>A Beautifying Wash.</i></p>

<p>Put into a cucurbit five pints of French Brandy; add to it a pound and
a half of Crumb of Bread, three ounces of Plum-tree-gum, two ounces of
Litharge of Silver in fine powder, and four ounces of sweet Almonds.
The ingredients are to be beat together into a paste, and left to
digest in the Spirit eight days; then distil in a vapour-bath, and wash
the face and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>hands with the water thus obtained. It must be suffered

presently become clear and glossy.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r90"></a>90. <i>A distilled Water that tinges the Cheeks a beautiful Carnation
Hue.</i></p>

<p>Take two quarts of White Wine Vinegar, three ounces of Isinglass, two
ounces of bruised Nutmegs, and six ounces of Honey; distil with a
gentle fire, and add to the distilled Water a small quantity of Red
Sanders, in order to colour it. Before the Tincture is used, a Lady
should wash herself with Elder-flower Water, and then the cheeks will

the natural bloom of youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

with the other ingredients. To these add four ounces of Sugar Candy in
powder, as much Camphor, and the Crumb of three small Wheaten Loaves,
each <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>weighing about half a pound; digest the whole eighteen or twenty

ounces of Camphor; distil them in a vapour-bath; add to the distilled
Water a few grains of Musk, and expose it to the sun for the space of a
month, observing to take the vessel within doors every night. The way
to use this Water, is to dip the corner of a fine napkin in it, and

<p class="plabel"><a id="r95"></a>95. <i>A Preservative from Tanning.</i></p>

<p>Infuse in clean Water for three days a pound of Lupines, then take them

When the Lu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>pines are boiled tender, and the Water grows rather ropy,
press out the Liquor, and keep it for use. Whenever you are under a
necessity of exposing yourself to the sun, wash the face and neck with
this preparation.</p>

<p>The Oil of unripe Olives, in which a small quantity of Gum Mastic has

<p>Take Wild Cucumber-roots and Narcissus-roots, of each an equal
quantity; dry them in the shade, and reduce them to a very fine powder,
putting them afterwards into strong French Brandy, with which wash the
face, till it begins to itch; and then wash it with cold water. This
method must be repeated every day till a perfect cure is obtained,
which will soon happen, for this water has a slight caustic property,
and of course must remove all spots on the skin.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r100"></a>100. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take a handful of fresh Wood-ashes, boil them in a pint of clear Water,

<p>Take Barley-water, strained through a piece of fine linen cloth, and
drop into it a few drops of Balm of Gilead; shake the bottle for
several hours, until the Balsam is entirely incorporated with the
Water, which is known by the turbid milky appearance of the Mixture.
This greatly improves the complexion, and preserves the bloom of youth.
If used only once <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>a day, it takes away wrinkles, and gives the skin a
surprising lustre. Before this fluid is used, the face should be washed
clean with rain water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r106"></a>106. <i>A Water to change the Eye-brows black.</i></p>

<p>First wash your eyebrows with a decoction of Gall Nuts; then wet them
with a pencil or little brush dipped in a solution of Green Vitriol, in
which a little Gum Arabic has been dissolved, and when dry, they will
appear of a beautiful black colour.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r107"></a>107. <i>To remove Worms in the Face.</i></p>

<p>Make use of the distilled Waters of the Whites of Eggs, Bean Flowers,
Water Lilies, White Lilies, Melon Seeds, Iris Roots, Solomon's Seal,

during twenty-four hours; then distil to dryness in a vapour-bath, and
afterwards rectify the distilled Water, by repeating the same process.</p>

<p>This Water strengthens the gums, prevents the scurvy, and cures aphthæ,
or little ulcerations in the mouth. It is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>used to gargle the mouth
with, either by itself, or diluted with water, as occasion may require.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r109"></a>109. <i>Another Water for the Teeth, called Spirituous Vulnerary Water.</i></p>

<p>For this intention are commonly used Spirituous Waters, that are no
ways disagreeable; waters proper to strengthen and fortify the gums,
as Spirituous Vulnerary Water tinctured with Cochineal, or Seed Lac;
Guaiacum Water, or the Duchess de la Vrilliere's Water above described.</p>

<p>To tinge Vulnerary Water, put any quantity into a glass matrass, and
infuse in it some bruised Cochineal; then filter the Vulnerary Water,
and use it to gargle the mouth, after which the teeth are to be cleaned
with Tooth Powder. This, when <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>found too strong, may be lowered by the
addition of Spring Water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r110"></a>110. <i>Receipt to make Vulnerary Water.</i></p>

<p>Take fresh gathered Leaves of Sage, Angelica, Wormwood, Savory, Fennel,
and spiked Mint, of each four ounces; Leaves of Hyssop, Balm, Sweet
Basil, Rue, Thyme, Marjoram, Rosemary, Origanum, Calamint, and Wild
Thyme, fresh gathered, of each four ounces; the same quantity of
Lavender Flowers, and a gallon of rectified Spirit of Wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut the Herbs small, infuse them ten or twelve hours in Spirit of Wine,
and then distil in a vapour-bath. Preserve the Spirit drawn off, in a
bottle well corked.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r111"></a>111. <i>A Water for the Gums.</i></p>

<p>Take of the best Cinnamon, an ounce; Cloves, three drachms; the Yellow
Peel of two Lemons; Red Rose Leaves, half an ounce; Water Cresses, half
a pound; Scurvy Grass, four ounces; rectified Spirit of Wine, three
gallons: bruise the Spices, and infuse the whole a sufficient time in
the Spirit in a glass vessel; then distil off the Spirit for use, in a
vapour-bath.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r112"></a>112. <i>Another, prepared by Infusion.</i></p>

<p>Take two drachms of Cinnamon, finely powdered; half a drachm of Cloves,
in fine powder; and half an ounce of Roch Alum; pour on them three
gallons of boiling Water; when cold, add six ounces of Plantain Water,
half an ounce of Orange-flower Water, a quarter of an ounce of Essence
of Lemons, and a gill and a half of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>rectified Spirit of Wine; let the
whole stand together in digestion four and twenty hours, then filter
through paper, and reserve the clear water for use.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r113"></a>113. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Take Mace, Cinnamon, Cloves, Pellitory of Spain, and Terra Sigillata,
or Sealed Earth, of each half an ounce; beat the whole together in a
mortar, and infuse it a month in a quart of Spirit of Wine. Strain off
the Spirit, and add eight ounces of Spirit of Scurvy Grass. Drop six
or seven drops in a glass of very clear Water, and rince the mouth;
afterwards rubbing the gums with conserve of Hips acidulated with five
or six drops of Spirit of Vitriol.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r114"></a>114. <i>Another Water for the Gums.</i></p>

<p>Take of the best Cinnamon, an ounce; Cloves, three drachms; the Peel
of two Lemons; half an ounce of Red Rose Leaves; half a pound of Water
Cresses, four ounces of Scurvy Grass, and three gallons of rectified
Spirit of Wine. Bruise the Spices, and let the whole stand in digestion
in a glass vessel twenty-four hours; then distil in a vapour-bath.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r115"></a>115. <i>A simple Depilatory.</i></p>

<p>Oil of Walnuts frequently rubbed on a child's forehead, will prevent
the hair from growing on that part.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r116"></a>116. <i>Prepared Sponges for the Face.</i></p>

<p>Steep in Water some time the finest and thinnest Sponges you can pick
out; wash them well, dry them, and soak them <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>in Brandy a whole day;
then squeeze the Brandy out, and dry them again. Lastly, dip them in
Orange-flower Water, and let them remain in it eleven or twelve hours.
When squeezed, and thoroughly dried, they are fit for use.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r117"></a>117. <i>Spirit of Roses.</i></p>

<p>To make the inflammable Spirit of Roses, take twenty pounds of Damask
Roses, beat them to a Paste, in a marble mortar; put this Paste, layer
by layer, with sea salt, into a large stone jar, or two jars, if one
is not large enough to contain the whole quantity; that is to say,
sprinkle every layer of the Paste about half an inch thick with Salt;
and press the layers of Roses as close together as possible. Cork the
jar with a waxed cork, cover the upper-most end of the cork, and the
edges of the mouth of the jar, with wax also, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>place it six weeks,
or two months, in a vault, or some other cool place. At the expiration
of this period, open the jar; if it exhales a strong vinous smell,
the fermentation has arrived at its proper height; but if you do not
perceive such an odour, throw into the jar a little Yeast, and stop it
close in the same manner as before. A strong fermentation having been
excited, take five or six pounds of your fermented Rose Paste, put it
into a common cucurbit, and distil it with a very gentle fire in a
vapour-bath. When you have drawn off as much water as you can, unlute
the alembic; throw away what remains in the cucurbit, take five or
six pounds more of the fermented Paste of Roses, and put it into the
cucurbit, with the Water already drawn; distil in a vapour-bath with
such a degree of fire, as will cause the distilled Water <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>to run off
in a middling sized stream. When you can draw off no more, empty the
cucurbit, fill it again with fresh fermented Paste of Roses, and pour
on it all the distilled Water that the preceding distillations have
produced. Distil as before; and repeat these operations, till you have
used all your fermented Paste of Roses. Every time you open the jar,
be careful to cork it close, otherwise the most spirituous particles
will evaporate. After the last distillation, you will have obtained a
very fine scented Water, but not very spirituous, because loaded with a
considerable quantity of phlegm; and it must therefore be rectified.</p>

<p>For this purpose make choice of a very long necked glass matrass of a
reasonable size, fill it about three parts full with your unrectified
Spirit of Roses; fit on a bolt-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>head, and receiver; lute the joints
carefully, and distil in a vapour-bath with a very slow fire. When you
have drawn off about a tenth part of what was put into the matrass,
let the vessel cool, and set apart the Spirit that is found in the
receiver. What remains in the matrass must not be thrown away as
useless, for it is a Rose-water far superior to what is prepared
according to the usual method.</p>

<p>After the first rectification of a part of the Spirit, repeat the
same operation with another part, till the whole is rectified, and
then rectify them all together once more. After this last operation,
you will obtain a highly penetrating and inflammable Spirit of Roses.
The phlegmatic part that remains in the matrass may be added to that
procured from the preceding rectifications, and the whole kept for use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>in a cellar or other cool place in a bottle, well corked.</p>

<p>The scent of inflammable Spirit of Roses is extremely sweet; if only
two drops of it are mixed with a glass of Water, they impart to the
Water so high a perfume, that it exceeds the very best Rose-water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r118"></a>118. <i>Inflammable Spirits of all Kinds of Flowers.</i></p>

<p>To distil an inflammable Spirit from Flowers of all kinds, the
preceding method must be used; as also to procure one from all kinds of
vegetables. Only observe that in plants, and dried flowers, as Thyme,
Betony, Mint, Stechas, Violets, and Jasmine, the Seeds must be bruised
with the Flowers and Roots; as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>they also must with the Flowers of
the Tuberose Lily, Angelica, Iris; in odoriferous Fruits, as Oranges,
Lemons, Citrons, &amp;c. add the Rind of those Fruits to the Flowers; and
to the Flowers of Elder, Juniper, Lily of the Valley, and Acacia,
&amp;c. add the Berries well moistened; whether green or dry is of no
signification.</p>




<h2><a id="ESSENCES"></a>ESSENCES.</h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r119"></a>119. <i>Method of extracting Essences from Flowers.</i></p>

<p>Procure a wooden box lined with tin, that the wood may not communicate
any disagreeable flavour to the Flowers, nor imbibe the Essence. Make
several straining frames to fit the Box, each about two inches thick,
and drive in them a number of hooks, on which fix a piece of cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>licoe
stretched tight. The utmost care is requisite, to have the straining
cloths perfectly clean and dry before they are used.</p>

<p>After having caused the cloths to imbibe as much Oil of Ben as
possible, squeeze them a little, then stretch and fix them on the hooks
of the frames; put one frame thus completed at the bottom of the box,
and upon its cloth strow equally those flowers, the essence of which
you intend to extract; cover them with another frame, on the cloth of
which you are to strow more flowers, and continue to act in the same
manner till the box is quite filled. The frames being each about two
inches thick, the flowers undergo very little pressure, though they
lye between the cloths. At the expiration of twelve hours, apply fresh
flowers in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>the same manner, and continue so to do for some days. When
you think the scent powerful enough, take the cloths from the frames,
fold them in four, roll them up, and tie them tight with a piece of
whip-cord, to prevent their stretching out too much, then put them into
a press, and squeeze out the oil. The press must be lined with tin,
that the wood may not imbibe any part of the oil. Place underneath a
very clean earthen or glass vessel to receive the essence, which is to
be kept in bottles nicely corked.</p>

<p>The essence of one kind of flower only, can be made in a box at the
same time, for the scent of one would impair that of another. For the
same reason, the cloths that have been used to extract the essence
of any particular flower, cannot be used to extract the essence of
another, till <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>washed clean in a strong lye, and thoroughly dried
in the open air. This method is of great use to obtain the scent
of flowers which afford no Essential Oil by distillation, such as
Tuberoses, Jasmine, and several others.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r120"></a>120. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take any flowers you please, and put them in a large jar, layer by
layer, mixed with Salt, as directed for inflammable Spirit of Roses,
till the jar is quite full; then cork it tight, and let it stand in a
cellar, or some other cool place, for forty days; at the expiration of
which time, empty the whole into a sieve, or straining cloth, stretched
over the mouth of a glazed earthen or stone pan, to receive the essence
that drains from the flowers upon squeezing them gently. Afterwards
put the essence into a glass bottle, which must not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>be filled above
two thirds; cork it tight, and expose it to the heat of the sun in
fine weather, five and twenty or thirty days, to purify the essence, a
single drop of which will be capable of scenting a quart of Water or
any other Liquid.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r121"></a>121. <i>Essence of Ambergrise.</i></p>

<p>Take of Ambergrise a quarter of an ounce; the same quantity of Sugar
Candy; Musk, half a drachm; and Civet, two grains; rub them together,
and put the mixture into a Phial: pour upon it a quarter of a pint of
tartarised Spirit of Wine, stop close the Phial, which set in a gentle
sand heat for four or five days, and then decant the clear Tincture for
use. This makes the best of perfumes; the least touch of it leaves its
scent upon any thing a great time; and in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>stitutions where such
sweets are not offensive to the head, nothing can be a more immediate
Cordial.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r122"></a>122. <i>A Remedy for St. Anthony's Fire or Erysipelatous Eruptions on the
Face.</i></p>

<p>Take Narcissus Roots, an ounce; fresh Nettle-seeds, half an ounce; beat
them together into a soft Paste with a sufficient quantity of White
Wine Vinegar, and anoint the eruptions therewith every night; or, bathe
the part affected with the Juice of Cresses.</p>

<h2><a name="FLOWERS" id="FLOWERS">FLOWERS.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r123"></a>123. <i>Manner of drying Flowers, so as to preserve their natural
Colours.</i></p>

<p>Take fine White Sand, wash it repeatedly, till it contains not the
least earth <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>or salt, then dry it for use. When thoroughly dry, fill
a glass or stone jar half full of Sand, in which stick the Flowers in
their natural situation, and afterwards cover them gently with the
same, about the eighth part of an inch above the Flower. Place the
glass in the sun, or, if in winter-time, in a room where a constant
fire is kept, till the Flower is perfectly dried. Then remove the Sand
with the utmost precaution, and clean the Leaves with a feather brush.
Particular Flowers lose in some measure their natural lively colours,
but this may be helped by the assistance of art.</p>

<p>Roses and other Flowers of a delicate colour, recover their natural
lustre by being exposed to a moderate vapour of Brimstone; but Crimson
or Scarlet Flowers, by being exposed to the vapour <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>of a solution of
Tin in Spirit of Nitre. The vapour of a solution of Filings of Steel in
Spirit of Vitriol, restores to the Leaves and Stalk, their primitive
green colour. This method succeeds perfectly well in single Flowers.
There are some difficulties with respect to Pinks, Carnations, and
other double Flowers; to succeed with them, split the cup on each side,
and when the Flower is quire dry, glue it together with Gum-water; or
prick the cup in different parts with a large pin.</p>

<p>As to the scent, which is in great measure lost in drying, it may be
restored, by dropping into the middle of the Flower a drop of its
Essential Oil; for instance, a drop of Oil of Roses on a Rose, Oil of
Cloves on a Clove-july-flower, Oil of Jasmine on a Jasmine Flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r124"></a>124. <i>A Secret to preserve Flowers.</i></p>

<p>Fill an earthen, copper, or wooden vessel half full of sifted Sand,
then fill it up to the brim with clear Spring Water, and stir the Sand
well with a stick in order to detach the earthy particles. When the
Sand has thoroughly settled, pour off the turbid Water by inclination,
add fresh Water, and continue to wash the Sand, till all the Water that
floats on its surface remains perfectly clear. The Sand being thus
cleansed, expose it to the heat of the sun a sufficient time, to exhale
entirely its humidity. Prepare for every Flower an earthen or tin
vessel of a proper size, make choice of the finest, most perfect, and
driest Flowers of their respective kinds, and be careful to leave the
stalks of a good length. Place <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>them upright in the vessel, with one
hand as lightly as possible, about two or three inches below the rims,
so as not to touch the sides, or each other; and with the other hand
gradually pour on them the Sand till the stalk is quite covered; then
lightly cover the Flower itself, separating the Leaves a little. The
Tulip requires a farther operation. The triangular top that rises out
of the middle of the cup, must be cut off, by which means the Leaves
of the Flower will adhere better to the Stalk. When the vessel is
filled with Flowers, leave it a month or two exposed to the rays of the
sun; and the Flowers when taken out, though dry, will be very little
inferior in beauty to new-blown Flowers, but will have lost their scent.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p class="plabel"><a id="r125"></a>125. <i>Another Secret to preserve Flowers.</i></p>

<p>Take the finest River Sand you can get, after having sifted it several
times through a fine sieve, throw it into a glass vessel full of clear
Water, and rub it a good while between your fingers to render it still
finer; then pour off the Water by inclination, and dry the Sand in
the sun. The Sand being thus prepared, bury the Flowers gently in it
with their Leaves and Stalk, disposing them in such a manner that
their form may not be in the least injured. After having thus kept
Flowers some time, till their humid particles are entirely evaporated,
take them out, and inclose them in bottles, well corked; secure them
from all changes of the atmosphere, but let them enjoy a temperate
warmth; for if the heat is too great, the colours fade; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>and if not
kept sufficiently warm, the humidity of the Flowers will not wholly
evaporate.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r126"></a>126. <i>Another Method of preserving Flowers a long while, in their
natural Shape and Colour.</i></p>

<p>Take the finest River Sand, divested of whatever impurities it may
contain; then dry it in the sun or a stove, sift it through a sieve,
and only make use of the finest part. Procure a Tin Box, or a Wooden
Box lined with Tin, of any size you think proper, cover the bottom of
the Box three or four inches deep with prepared Sand, and stick in it
the Stalks of the Flowers in rows, but in such a manner that none of
the Flowers may touch each other, afterwards filling the vacuities
between the Stalks with Sand. Then spread the Sand all round the
Flowers, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>which cover with a layer about two or three inches thick. Put
this Box in a place exposed to the sun, or in some warm situation, for
the space of a month. With respect to Tulips, the pistil that rises in
the middle, and contains the Seed, must be dexterously cut out, and the
empty space filled with Sand: too many Flowers should not be put into
the same Box, nor should the Box be too large.</p>

<h2><a name="GLOVES" id="GLOVES">GLOVES.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r127"></a>127. <i>White Gloves Scented With Jasmine after the Italian manner.</i></p>

<p>Take half an ounce of White Wax; dissolve it over a gentle fire in
two ounces of Oil of Ben. Dress your skins with this Liquid, dry them
on lines, and clean <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>them well with the purest water; when they are
dried and properly stretched, make them up into gloves, which are to
have the Jasmine Flowers applied to them eight days according to the
usual method; then bring them into shape, and fold them smooth. This
manner of working them up, communicates to the gloves the property of
retaining the scent of the Flowers much better than those that are
drest otherwise, and likewise imparts to them the virtue of preserving
the hands and arms delicately soft and white.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r128"></a>128. <i>Gloves scented without Flowers.</i></p>

<p>Take an ounce of Liquid Storax, an ounce of Rose-wood, the same
quantity of Florentine Orrice, and half an ounce of Yellow Sanders.
Beat the three last articles into a very fine powder, and add to it the
Storax, with the earths that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>you use to dye your gloves, and a little
Gum Arabic. Then take an equal quantity of Rose and Orange Flower
Water, to temper this composition which you lay on your gloves; when
they are dry, rub them well, and fold them up; then dress them afresh
with a little Gum Water, in which has been dissolved some powder of
Florentine Orrice; hang them up to dry, and afterwards bring them into
form, and fold them up as fit for use.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r129"></a>129. <i>White Gloves scented with Ketmia or Musk Seed.</i></p>

<p>Take an ounce of Yellow Sanders, an ounce of Florentine Orrice, an
ounce of Gum Benjamin, two ounces of Rose-wood, and a drachm of Storax;
reduce the whole to fine powder, with as much Ceruss as you choose.
Mix them with Rose-water, and dress your gloves with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>the mixture as
neatly as you can for the first coat; then rub them well, and open them
when they are thoroughly dry. Use the same for the second coat, with
the addition of a little Gum Arabic. For the third coat, levigate on a
marble, eight grains of Ketmia Seed, four grains of Civet, a little Oil
of Ben, and a very little Gum Tragacanth, dissolved in Rose-water; add
to this composition a quarter of a pint of Orange Flower Water; after
having applied this third coat to your gloves, bring them into form,
before they get thoroughly dry.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r130"></a>130. <i>To colour Gloves a curious French Yellow.</i></p>

<p>Take Chalk and Wood Ashes, of each an equal quantity, and make a strong
Lye of them; then strain off the clear Liquor, and simmer it over the
fire with a little <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Turmeric in powder, and a very little Saffron, till
it becomes pretty thick; after which set the liquor by to cool, and it
is fit for use.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r131"></a>131. <i>An excellent Perfume for Gloves.</i></p>

<p>Take Ambergrise, a drachm; the same quantity of Civet; and of Orange
Flower Butter, a quarter of an ounce; mix these ingredients well, and
rub them into the gloves with fine Cotton Wool, pressing the perfume
into them.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r132"></a>132. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take of Essence of Roses, half an ounce; Oil of Cloves and Mace, of
each a drachm; Frankincense, a quarter of an ounce; mix them, and lay
them in papers between your gloves. Being hard pressed, the gloves will
take the scent in twenty-four hours, and afterwards hardly ever lose
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r133"></a>133. <i>An excellent Receipt to clear a tanned Complexion.</i></p>

<p>At night going to rest, bathe the face with the Juice of Strawberries,
and let it lie on the part all night, and in the morning wash yourself
with Chervil Water. The skin will soon become fair and smooth.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r134"></a>134. <i>Or,</i></p>

<h2><a name="OILS" id="OILS">OILS.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r137"></a>137. <i>A Cosmetic Oil.</i></p>

<p>Take a quarter of a pint of Oil of Sweet Almonds, fresh drawn; two
ounces of Oil of Tartar per Deliquium; and four drops of Oil of
Rhodium: mix the whole together, and make use of it to cleanse and
soften the skin.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r138"></a>138. <i>Another Cosmetic Oil.</i></p>

<p>Take a pint of Cream, infuse in it a few Water Lilies, Bean Flowers,
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Roses; simmer the whole together in a vapour-bath, and keep the
Oil that proceeds from it in a vial, which is to be left for some time
exposed to the evening dews.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r139"></a>139. <i>Oil of Wheat.</i></p>

<p>This Oil is extracted by an Iron Press, in the same manner as Oil
of Almonds. It is excellent for Chaps in either the lips or hands,
tetterous eruptions, and rigidity of the skin.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r140"></a>140. <i>Compound Oil, or Essence of Fennel.</i></p>

<p>Take five pints of the best French Brandy, and the same quantity of
White-Wine; three quarters of a pound of bruised Fennel Seeds, and half
an ounce of Liquorice Root sliced and bruised. Put the whole into an
alembic, close the mouth with Parchment, and set it in a hot <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>house,
or in hot ashes, two days; then distil off the Liquor with an uniform
middling fire. What remains after the distillation of the Essence, and
is called the White Drops, is only fit to wash the hands with.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r141"></a>141. <i>To make Oil of Tuberoses and Jasmine.</i></p>

<p>Bruise a little the Tuberoses or Jasmine Flowers in a marble mortar
with a wooden pestle; put them into a proper vessel, with a sufficient
quantity of Oil of Olives, and let them stand in the sun in a close
stopped vessel twelve or fifteen days to infuse; at the expiration of
which time, squeeze the Oil from the Flowers. Let the Oil stand in
the sun to settle, then pour it clear off the dregs. This Oil is very
fragrant, and well impregnated with the Essential Oil of these Flowers.
Infuse a fresh parcel of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>Flowers, newly gathered, in the same Oil, and
proceed as before: repeat this operation twelve or fourteen times, or
even oftener if necessary, till the Oil is fully impregnated with the
flavour of the Flowers. Some people use Oil of Ben instead of Sallad
Oil, which in our opinion is preferable, being infinitely less apt to
grow rancid. The Oils of Tuberoses, and Jasmine Flowers are of use for
the Toilet on account of their fragrancy. There are cases in which they
may be successfully used externally by way of friction, to comfort and
strengthen the nerves, and brace up the skin when too much relaxed.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r142"></a>142. <i>An Oil scented with Flowers for the Hair.</i></p>

<p>Sallad Oil, Oil of Sweet Almonds, and Oil of Nuts, are the only ones
used for scenting the hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Blanch your Almonds in Hot Water, and when dry, reduce them to powder;
sift them through a fine sieve, strewing a thin layer of Almond-powder,
and one of Flowers, over the bottom of the Box lined with Tin. When
the box is full, leave them in this situation about twelve hours;
then throw away the Flowers, and add fresh ones in the same manner as
before, repeating the operation every day for eight successive days.
When the Almond-powder is thoroughly impregnated with the scent of the
Flower made choice of, put it into a new clean Linen Cloth, and with
an Iron Press extract the Oil, which will be strongly scented with the
fragrant perfume of the Flower.</p>

<h2><a name="ESSENTIAL_OILS_or_QUINTESSENCES" id="ESSENTIAL_OILS_or_QUINTESSENCES"><span class="smcap">ESSENTIAL OILS, or QUINTESSENCES.</span></a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r143"></a>143. <i>Essential Oil, commonly called Quintessence of Lavender.</i></p>

<p>Fill a cucurbit two thirds full with unwashed Lavender Flowers, pour
upon them as much clear Water as will float about two inches above the
Flowers. Fit to the cucurbit a head with a short neck, and lute on the
refrigeratory vessel. Distil in the common manner with a fire of such
a degree of strength as will cause the distilled water to run off in a
thick thread. The phlegm and spirit will come over in a considerable
quantity, and the Essential Oil, with which Lavender greatly abounds,
will soon appear floating on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>surface of the Water in the receiver;
which is to be separated according to the rules of art. As soon as you
perceive that no more Oil drops into the receiver, which generally
happens to be the case a good while before the phlegm is entirely
drawn off, finish your distillation. If you want a larger quantity of
Quintessence, empty the still, put fresh Flowers, and adding the phlegm
and spirit drawn off by the former distillation, instead of so much
common Water, distil as before, till you have obtained a sufficient
quantity. This Quintessence possesses great medicinal virtues, and is
particularly serviceable in vapourish and hysteric disorders.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r144"></a>144. <i>To make Essence of Cinnamon.</i></p>

<p>Take half a pound of Cinnamon, reduce it in a mortar to an impalpable
pow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>der, put it into a very long necked matrass, pour on it as much
highly rectified Spirit of Wine as will cover the powder about an inch.
Stop the matrass with a found cork coated with bees-wax, and expose
it to the sun for a whole month, observing to shake it well twice a
day. At the expiration of the month, uncork the matrass, using the
utmost precaution not to disturb the sediment; and gently pour off the
Tincture into a clean vial.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r145"></a>145. <i>To make Quintessence of Cloves.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Take a pound of Cloves, beat them in a mortar, put them into a glass
vessel, and pour on them a gallon of hot but not boiling water, cork
the bottle close with a waxed cork, placed in a warm place, and let the
Cloves infuse three weeks or a month; then empty the contents of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>bottle into a middling sized still, fit on a low head with a short
neck, and distil in the common manner, with a fire of such a degree
of fierceness as to make the distilled Water run off in a stream,
resembling a thick thread. The Quintessence will come over with the
Spirit, mixed with a large quantity of Phlegm; but being heavier than
either of those substances, will be found precipitated to the bottom
of the receiver. Separate it in the usual manner, and keep it for use
in a vial closely corked. Then unlute your still, and throw in the
spirituous Water that remains after the separation of the Quintessence;
distil it a second time, and you will obtain a small quantity more,
which may be added to the former.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r146"></a>146. <i>A Cosmetic Juice.</i></p>

<p>Make a hole in a Lemon, fill it with Sugar Candy, and close it nicely
with leaf Gold applied over the Rind that was cut out; then roast the
Lemon in hot ashes. When desirous of using the Juice, squeeze out a
little through the hole, and wash the face with a napkin wetted with
it. This Juice greatly cleanses the skin, and brightens the complexion.</p>

<h2><a name="VIRGINs_MILK" id="VIRGINs_MILK">VIRGIN's MILK.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r147"></a>147. <i>A safe and approved Cosmetic.</i></p>

<p>Take equal parts of Gum Benjamin, and Storax, and dissolve them in a
sufficient quantity of Spirit of Wine. The spirit will then become a
reddish Tincture, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>and exhale a very fragrant smell. Some people add a
little Balm of Gilead. Drop a few Drops into a glass of clear Water,
and the Water, by stirring, will instantly become milky. Ladies use
it successfully to clear the complexion, for which purpose nothing is
better, or indeed so innocent and safe.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r148"></a>148. <i>Another, very easily made.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Beat a quantity of Houseleek in a marble mortar, squeeze out the Juice
and clarify it. When you want to use it, pour a few drops of rectified
Spirit on the Juice, and it will instantly turn milky. It is a very
efficacious remedy for a pimpled face, and preserves the skin soft and
smooth.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r149"></a>149. <i>Another.</i></p>

<p>Take a half-gallon bottle, pour into it a quart of Spirit of Wine, and
a pint of clear Brandy; then add a quarter of a pound of the finest Gum
Benjamin, two ounces of Storax, half an ounce of Cinnamon, two drachms
of Cloves, and a Nutmeg, all bruised, and four drops of Quintessence of
Egyptian Ketmia. Carefully cork the bottle, and expose it to the sun a
month; but take it within doors in rainy weather. At the month's end,
gently draw off the clear Tincture; and you will have a fragrant Milk,
which is used by pouring a few drops on a wet napkin.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r150"></a>150. <i>A Liniment to destroy Vermin.</i></p>

<p>Take an ounce of Vinegar, the same quantity of Stavesacre, half an
ounce of Honey, and half an ounce of Sulphur; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>mix into the consistence
of a soft liniment, with two ounces of Sallad Oil.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2><a name="LOTIONS" id="LOTIONS">LOTIONS.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r151"></a>151. <i>A Lotion to strengthen the Gums, and sweeten the Breath.</i></p>

<p>Take Mountain Wine, and the distilled Water of Bramble Leaves, of each
a pint; half an ounce of Cinnamon; a quarter of an ounce of Cloves;
the same quantity of Seville Orange-peel; Gum Lacque and Burnt Alum,
of each a drachm, all in fine powder. Having added two ounces of fine
Honey, put the whole into a glass bottle, and let them infuse on hot
ashes the space of four days. On the fifth day squeeze the Liquor
through a thick linen cloth, and preserve it in a bottle, well corked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>When the gums are relaxed, and want bracing, take a spoonful of this
Liquid, and pour it into a glass. First use one half to rince the
mouth; and after retaining it a little, spirt it out. Use the remainder
in the same way, rubbing the gums with one of your fingers; and
afterwards rince the mouth with warm-water. Repeat the operation every
morning, or twice a day, if occasion requires.</p>

<p>To render this remedy more efficacious, add to the whole quantity of
the Lotion half a pint of Cinnamon Water, distilled from White Wine.</p>

<p>The eastern nations, to procure a sweet breath, to render the teeth
beautifully white, and fasten the gums, frequently chew boiled Chio
Turpentine, or Gum Mastic. The Indians who live beyond <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>the Ganges
chew it all day long, and are so used to this habit, that they cannot
without difficulty refrain from it.</p>

<p>The Spirituous Water of Guaiacum possesses the property of giving ease
in the tooth-ache, and fastening the teeth in their sockets. The mouth
is to be gargled with a quantity mixed in a glass of clear Water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r152"></a>152. <i>Another Lotion to fasten the Teeth and sweeten the Breath.</i></p>

<p>Pour three pints of Water into an earthen or stone jar, dip in it four
different times a red hot poker, and then immediately add an ounce
of bruised Cinnamon, six grains of Burnt Alum, an ounce of powdered
Pomegranate Bark, three ounces of fine Honey; of Vulnerary Water, Rue
Water, and Myrtle Water, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>each a quarter of a pint; and of Brandy,
half a pint. The whole being well mixed, tie a wet bladder over the
mouth of the jar, and let it stand in the sun, or any warm place, for
twenty-four hours; then strain off the Liquor through a thick linen
cloth, or strong straining bag. Add to it two ounces of Spirit of
Scurvy-grass, and keep it in a bottle, well corked. It is used in the
same manner as the preceding Lotion.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r153"></a>153. <i>An admirable Lotion for the Complexion.</i></p>

<p>After having washed the face with Soap and Water, wash yourself with
the following lixivium. Take clear Lees prepared from Vine Ashes, and
to every pound of it, add an ounce of calcined Tartar, two drachms of
Gum Sandarach, and as much Gum Juniper. Let this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>Lotion dry on the
face without wiping it off, and afterwards wash yourself with Imperial
Water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r154"></a>154. <i>An admirable Varnish for the Skin.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Take equal parts of Lemon Juice, and Whites of new laid Eggs, beat them
well together in a glazed earthen pan, which put on a slow fire, and
keep the mixture constantly stirring with a wooden spatula, till it
has acquired the consistence of soft butter. Keep it for use, and at
the time of applying it, add a few drops of any Essence you like best.
Before the face is rubbed with this varnish, it will be proper to wash
with the distilled Water of rice. This is one of the best methods of
rendering the complexion fair, and the skin smooth, soft, and shining.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r155"></a>155. <i>A Liniment to destroy Nits.</i></p>

<p>Take Oil of Bays, Oil of Sweet Almonds, and old Hogs Lard, of each two
ounces, powdered Stavesacre, and Tansy Juice, of each half an ounce;
Aloes, and Myrrh, of each a quarter of an ounce, the smaller Centaury
and Salt of Sulphur, of each a drachm; mix the whole into a liniment.

Orpiment, an ounce of Florentine Orrice, half an ounce of Sulphur,
the same quantity of Nitre, and a pound or pint of a Lixivium made of
Bean-stalk Ashes; boil the whole to a proper consistence, which may
be known by dipping a wet feather into it. It is boiled enough when
the feathery part of the quill easily separates from the other. Then
add half an ounce of Oil of Lavender, or any aromatic Essence, and mix
into a Liniment, with which if you rub the hair that grows on any part
of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>body, it will immediately drop off. When the hair is removed,
foment the part with Oil of Sweet Almonds, or Oil of Roses.</p>

<p>Take a quarter of a pound of Gum Ivy dissolved in Vinegar, a drachm of
Orpiment, a drachm of Ant Eggs, and two drachms of Gum Arabic dissolved
in Juice of Henbane, in which half an ounce of Quick-lime has been

Fowls Grease, and apply a little to the part where you would wish to
destroy the Hair, after being clean shaved.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r159"></a>159. <i>An excellent Lip-Salve.</i></p>

<p>Take an ounce of Myrrh, as much Litharge in fine powder, four ounces
of Honey, two ounces of Bees-wax, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>six ounces of Oil of Roses; mix
them over a slow fire. Those who are inclined may add a few drops of
Oil of Rhodium, and some Leaf Gold.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r160"></a>160. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take Armenian Bole, Myrrh, and Ceruss in fine powder, of each an
ounce; mix with a sufficient quantity of Goose-grease into a proper

rolling-pin, and cut it into Lozenges with a knife.</p>

<p>To form scented Pastils, roll up bits of this Paste in the shape of a
cone, that they may stand upright, and set them by to dry. These kind
of Pastils are lighted in the same manner as a candle. They consume

or Rose-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>water. Take a handful of powder, and incorporate it well with
this mixture, then sift it through a sieve; add two or three pounds

a hot pestle, and rub it well with a handful of powder; after which
add, by little and little, six pounds of powder; then sift the whole
through a hair sieve to incorporate it with the other perfumed powder.
The Ambergrise must be well rubbed in the mortar; and by degrees two
pounds of powder, either white or grey, must be added to it, till
the Ambergrise is thoroughly incorporated with the powder; then sift
through a hair sieve, and mix all the three powders together. This
perfume is to be kept in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Leather Bag, the seams of which are well
sewed with waxed thread.</p>

of the little finger, narrower at top than at bottom, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>that they may
stand firm and upright. When they are thoroughly dry, light them at
the narrow end, and let them burn till they are wholly consumed. While
burning they afford an exquisite perfume. To render the perfume still
higher, add six grains of Ambergrise.</p>

pound of the Crumb of White Bread, a quarter of a pound of Borax, and
as much Burnt Roch Alum. Simmer the whole together, and when almost
boiled enough, add an ounce of Spermaceti. Stir the composition well
with a spatula to prevent it from burning to the bottom of the pan; and
let it simmer but very gently.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r182"></a>182. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Dry, before the fire, half a pound of Bitter Almonds blanched, then
beat them in a marble mortar as fine as possible, and add a little
boiled Milk to prevent the Almonds from turning oily. Beat in the same
manner the Crumb of two French Bricks, with four Yolks of Eggs boiled
hard, and with the addition of some fresh Milk knead them into a paste,
which incorporate with that of the Almonds.</p>

<h2><a name="POMATUMS" id="POMATUMS">POMATUMS.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r183"></a>183. <i>Cold Cream, or Pomatum for the Complexion.</i></p>

<p>Take White Wax and Spermaceti, of each a drachm; Oil of Sweet Almonds,
two ounces; Spring Water, an ounce and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>a half; melt the Wax and
Spermaceti together in the Oil of Almonds, in a glazed earthen pipkin,
over hot ashes, or in a vapour-bath; pour the solution into a marble
mortar, and stir it about with a wooden pestle, till it grow cold, and
seem quite smooth; then mix the Water gradually, and keep stirring,
till the whole is incorporated. This pomatum becomes extremely white
and light by the agitation, and very much resembles cream, from its
similitude to which it has obtained its name.</p>

<p>This pomatum is an excellent cosmetic, and renders the skin supple and
smooth. Some add a little Balm of Gilead to heighten its virtue; and
it is sometimes scented, by using Rose-water or Orange-flower Water in
the preparation, instead of Spring-water, or with a few drops of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>Essence, as fancy directs. It is also very good to prevent marks in
the face from the Small-pox; in which last case, a little powder of
Saffron, or some desiccative powder, such as Flowers of Zinc or French
Chalk, is usually added. Keep it for use in a large gallypot tied over
with a bladder.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r184"></a>184. <i>Cucumber Pomatum.</i></p>

<p>Take Hog's Lard, a pound; ripe Melons, and Cucumbers, of each three
pounds, Verjuice, half a pint; two pippins pared, and a pint of Cow's
Milk. Slice the Melons, Cucumbers, and Apples, having first pared
them; bruise them in the Verjuice, and, together with the Milk and
Hog's Lard, put them into an alembic. Let them infuse in a vapour-bath
eight or ten hours; then squeeze out the Liquor through a straining
cloth while the mixture is hot, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>and expose it to the cold air, or set
it in a cool place to congeal. Afterwards pour off the watery part
that subsides, and wash it in several Waters, till the last remains
perfectly clear. Melt the pomatum again in a vapour-bath several times,
to separate from it all its humid particles, and every extraneous
substance; otherwise it will soon grow rancid. Keep it for use in a
gallypot tied over with a bladder.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r185"></a>185. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>A more simple Cucumber Pomatum may be made by simmering together Hog's
Lard and pared Cucumbers cut in thin slices. With respect to the rest
of the process, follow the method laid down for preparing Lip-salve;
and keep this pomatum in the same manner as the former.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Both these pomatums are good Cosmetics; they soften the skin, and
preserve it cool and smooth.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r186"></a>186. <i>Lavender Pomatum.</i></p>

<p>Take two pounds and a half of Hog's Lard, ten pounds of Lavender
Flowers, and a quarter of a pound of Virgin's Wax; put two pounds of
picked Lavender Flowers into a proper vessel with the Hog's Lard, and
knead them with your hands into as uniform a paste as possible. Put
this mixture into a pewter, tin, or stone pot, and cork it tight;
place the vessel in a vapour-bath, and let it stand six hours; at the
expiration of which time, strain the mixture through a coarse linen
cloth, with the assistance of a press. Throw away the Lavender Flowers
as useless, pour the melted Lard back into the same pot, and add four
pounds of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>fresh Lavender Flowers. Stir the Lard and Flowers together
while the Lard is in a liquid state, in order to mix them thoroughly;
and repeat the former process. Continue to act in this manner till
the whole quantity of Lavender Flowers is used. Then set in a cool
place the pomatum separated from the Lavender Flowers, that it may
congeal; pour off the brown aqueous juice extracted from them; and wash
the Pomatum in several waters, stirring it with a wooden spatula, to
separate any remaining watery particles, till the last water remains
perfectly colourless. Then melt the Pomatum in a vapour-bath, and keep
it in that state about an hour, in a vessel well corked; leaving it
afterwards to congeal. Repeat this last operation till the aqueous
particles are entirely extracted when the Wax must be added, and the
Pomatum having been again melted, in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>vapour-bath, in a vessel
closely corked, be suffered to congeal as before. When properly
prepared, fill it into gallypots, and tye the mouths over with wet
bladders, to prevent the air from penetrating.</p>

<p>This Pomatum is extremely fragrant, but is used only for dressing the
hair.</p>

<p>In the same manner are prepared, Orange-flower Pomatum, Jasmine
Pomatum, and all Pomatums made of odoriferous flowers. Common Pomatum
scented with the essences of any such flowers, may be used as a good
succedaneum.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r187"></a>187. LIP-SALVES.</p>

<p>Take three ounces of Oil of Almonds, three quarters of an ounce of
Spermaceti, and a quarter of an ounce of Vir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>gin's Wax; melt them
together over a slow fire, mixing with them a little of the powder of
Alkanet Root. Keep stirring till cold, and then add a few drops of Oil

bruised. Simmer these ingredient together for a quarter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>of an hour;
afterwards strain the mixture through a fine linen cloth; and pour
into your pomatum, which must be again set on the fire, a spoonful of
Orange-flower Water. Having let them simmer together a little while,
take the pan off the fire, and keep the pomatum stirring till it become
quite cold. It will keep a long while, and is a perfect cure for
chapped lips.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r190"></a>190. <i>A Yellow Lip-Salve.</i></p>

<p>Take Yellow Bee's Wax, two ounces and a half; Oil of Sweet Almonds, a
quarter of a pint; melt the Wax in the Oil, and let the mixture stand
till it become cold, when it acquires a pretty stiff consistence.
Scrape it into a marble mortar, and rub it with a wooden pestle, to
render it perfectly smooth. Keep it for use in a gallypot, closely
covered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>It is emollient and lenient; of course good for chaps in the lips,
hands, or nipples; and preserves the skin soft and smooth.</p>

<p>A Crust of Bread applied hot, is an efficacious remedy for pimples that
rise on the lips, in consequence of having drank out of a glass after
an uncleanly person.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r191"></a>191. <i>A Scarlet Lip-Salve.</i></p>

<p>Take Hog's Lard washed in Rose-water, half a pound; Red Roses and
Damask Roses bruised, a quarter of a pound; knead them together and let
them lie in that state two days. Then melt the Hog's Lard, and strain

the Hog's Lard, and let them lie together two days as before; then
gently simmer the mixture in a vapour-bath. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>Press out the Lard, and
keep it for use in the same manner as other Lip-salves.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r192"></a>192. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take an ounce of Oil of Sweet Almonds cold drawn, a drachm of fresh

spatula to make the flesh white. Drain the flesh dry, and putting it
into a new earthen pipkin, with a pint of Rose-water, and a Lemon stuck
with Cloves, simmer them over the fire till the skum looks reddish.
Skim this off, and removing the pipkin from the fire, strain the

with another. Change the Flowers for fresh ones every twelve hours,
and continue to pursue this method for ten or twelve days; mixing the
pomatum well, and spreading it out every time that fresh Flowers are

and be exposed to the heat of the sun during the whole summer; for the
first month stirring them every other day with a stick, and taking them
within doors in rainy weather. Towards the end of the season, they will
afford an excellent composition for a perfume; which may be rendered
yet more fragrant, by adding a little scented Cypress-powder, mixed

becomes well perfumed; then beat it to fine powder, and to every pound
add a quarter of an ounce of Musk, and as much Civet.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r219"></a>219. <i>Perfumed Powder.</i></p>

<p>Take a pound of Florentine Orrice-root, two ounces of Gum Benjamin,
a pound of dried Roses, an ounce of Storax, an ounce and a half of
Yellow Sanders, a quarter of an ounce of Cloves, and a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>small quantity
of Lemon-peel; beat the whole together into fine powder, and then add
twenty pounds of Starch-powder. Sift through a lawn sieve; and colour
the powder according to your fancy.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r220"></a>220. <i>The White Powder that enters into the Composition of the
Delightful Perfume.</i></p>

<p>Take a pound of Florentine Orrice-root, twelve Cuttle-fish Bones, eight
pounds of Starch, and a handful of Sheep or Bullock's Bones calcined
to whiteness; beat the whole into a powder, and sift it through a fine
hair sieve.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r221"></a>221. <i>Prepared Powder.</i></p>

<p>Pour a quart of Brandy, or an ounce of highly rectified Spirit of Wine,
on a pound or a pound and a half of Starch, mix them together; then dry
the Starch, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>beat it to powder, and sift it through a fine lawn sieve.
If you please you may add a little powder of Florentine Orrice-root.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r222"></a>222. <i>A Powder to nourish the Hair.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Take Roots of the Sweet Flag, Calamus Aromaticus, and Red Roses dried,
of each an ounce and a half; Gum Benjamin, an ounce; Aloes Wood,
three quarters of an ounce; Red Coral prepared, and Amber prepared,
of each half an ounce; Bean Flour, a quarter of a pound, Florentine
Orrice-roots, half a pound; mix the whole together, then beat into a
fine powder, and add to it five grains of Musk, and the same quantity
of Civet. This powder greatly promotes the regeneration of the hair,
and strengthens and nourishes its roots. The property of enlivening the
imagination, and helping the memory is also attributed to it.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r223"></a>223. <i>Common Powder.</i></p>

<p>The best Starch dried is generally the basis of all Hair-powders:
as are, sometimes, worm-eaten or rotten Wood, dried Bones, or Bones
calcined to whiteness, which are sifted through a fine hair sieve after
they have been beaten to powder. This kind of Powder readily takes any
scent, particularly that of Florentine Orrice, a root which naturally
possesses a violet smell. Of these Roots, the whitest and soundest are
made choice of; they are to be powdered as fine as possible, and this
can only be done during the summer.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r224"></a>224. <i>White Powder.</i></p>

<p>Take four pounds of Starch, half a pound of Florentine Orrice-root, six
Cuttle-fish Bones; Ox Bones and Sheeps <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>Bones calcined to whiteness,
of each half a handful; beat the whole together, and sift the Powder
through a very fine sieve.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r225"></a>225. <i>Grey Powder.</i></p>

<p>To the Residuum of the preceding add a little Starch and Wood-ashes in
fine powder; rub them together in a mortar some time, and then sift
through a fine hair sieve.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r226"></a>226. <i>Another.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Take the Marc or Residuum of the White Powder, mix with it a little
Starch, Yellow Ochre, and Wood-ashes or Baker's Coals to colour it.
Beat the whole well in a mortar, then sift it through a hair sieve.
Beat the coarser parts over again, and sift a second time; repeating
these operations till all the composition has passed through the sieve.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r227"></a>227. <i>Flaxen coloured Powder.</i></p>

<p>Add to the White Powder a very little Yellow Ochre. The White Powder
may be tinged of any colour, by adding ingredients of the colour you
fancy.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r228"></a>228. <i>Bean Flour.</i></p>

<p>Grind any quantity of Beans, and sift the Meal through a very fine lawn
sieve. It will take no other scent than that of Florentine Orrice.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r229"></a>229. <i>To sweeten the Breath.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Roll up a little ball of Gum Tragacanth, scent it with some odoriferous
Essence or Oil, and hold it in the mouth. A little Musk may be added to
the ball while rolling up, where that perfume is not disagreeable.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r230"></a>230. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>After having eat Garlic or Onions, chew a little raw Parsley. It will
infallibly take away their offensive smell.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r231"></a>231. <i>A Remedy for scorbutic Gums.</i></p>

<p>Bruise Cinquefoil in a marble mortar, squeeze out the juice, warm it
over the fire, and rub the Gums with it every night and morning.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r232"></a>232. <i>A Remedy for Moist Feet.</i></p>

<p>Take twenty pounds of Lee made of the Ashes of the Bay Tree, three
handfuls of Bay Leaves, a handful of Sweet Flag, with the same quantity
of Calamus Aromaticus, and Dittany of Crete; boil the whole together
for some time, then strain off the liquor, and add two quarts of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>Wine.
Steep your feet in this bath an hour every day, and in a short time
they will no longer exhale a disagreeable smell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Alkanet Root strikes a beautiful red when mixed with Oils or Pomatums.
A Scarlet or Rose-coloured Ribband wetted with Water or Brandy, gives
the Cheeks, if rubbed with it, a beautiful bloom that can hardly be
distinguished from the natural colour. Others only use a Red Sponge,
which tinges the cheeks of a fine carnation colour.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r239"></a>239. <i>Another.</i></p>


<p>Alum, beat them together into a coarse powder, and boil in a sufficient
quantity of Red Wine, till two thirds of the Liquor are consumed. When
this decoction has stood till cold, rub a little on the cheeks with a
bit of cotton.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r240"></a>240. <i>The Turkish Method of preparing Carmine.</i></p>

<p>Infuse, during three or four days, in a large jar filled with White
Wine Vinegar, a pound of Brazil Wood Shavings of Fernambuca, having
first beaten them to a coarse powder; afterwards boil them together
half an hour; then strain off the Liquor through a coarse linen cloth,
set it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>again upon the fire, and having dissolved half a pound of Alum
in White Wine Vinegar, mix both Liquors together, and stir the mixture
well with a spatula. The scum that rises is the Carmine; skim it off
carefully, and dry it for use.</p>

<p>Carmine may also be made with Cochineal, or Red Sanders, instead Brazil
Wood.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r241"></a>241. <i>A Liquid Rouge that exactly imitates
Nature.</i></p>

<p>Take a pint of good Brandy, and infuse in it half an ounce of Gum
Benjamin, an ounce of Red Sanders, and half an ounce of Brazil Wood,
both in coarse powder; with half an ounce of Roch Alum. Cork the bottle
tight, shake it well every day, and at the expiration of twelve days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>the Liquor will be fit for use. Touch the cheeks lightly with this

<p>Take thin Persian, and make it into little bags about four inches wide,
in the form of an oblong square. Rub the inside lightly with a little
Civet, then fill them with coarse powder a la Marechale, or any other
odoriferous Powder you choose; to which add a few Cloves, with a little

<p class="plabel"><a id="r245"></a>245. <i>An agreeable Sweet-Scented Composition.</i></p>

<p>Take Florentine Orrice, a pound and a half; Rose Wood, six ounces;
Calamus Aromaticus, half a pound; Yellow Sanders, a quarter of a pound;
Gum Benjamin, five ounces; Cloves, half an ounce; and Cinnamon, an
ounce: beat the whole into powder, and fill your bags with it.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r246"></a>246. <i>Ingredients for various Sorts of these little Bags or Satchels.</i></p>

<p>For this purpose may be used different parts of the Aromatic Plants; as
Leaves of Southernwood, Dragon-wort, Balm, Mint both garden and wild,
Dittany, Ground-ivy, Bay, Hyssop, Lovage, Sweet Marjoram, Origanum,

<h2><a name="WASH-BALLS" id="WASH-BALLS">WASH-BALLS.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r247"></a>247. <i>White Soap.</i></p>

<p>This soap is made with one part of the Lees of Spanish Pot-ash and
Quick-lime, to two parts of Oil of Olives or Oil of Almonds.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r248"></a>248. <i>Honey Soap.</i></p>

<p>Take four ounces of White Soap, and as much Honey, half an ounce
of Salt of Tartar, and two or three drachms of the distilled Water
of Fumitory; mix the whole together. This Soap cleanses the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>skin
well, and renders it delicately white and smooth. It is also used
advantageously, to efface the marks of burns and scalds.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r249"></a>249. <i>A perfumed Soap.</i></p>

<p>Take four ounces of Marsh-mallow Roots skinned and dried in the shade,
powder them, and add an ounce of Starch, the same quantity of Wheaten
Flour, six drachms of fresh Pine-nut Kernels, two ounces of blanched
Almonds, an ounce and a half of Orange Kernels husked, two ounces
of Oil of Tartar, the same quantity of Oil of Sweet Almonds, and
thirty grains of Musk: thoroughly incorporate the whole, and add to
every ounce, half an ounce of Florentine Orrice-root in fine powder.
Then steep half a pound of fresh Marsh-mallow Roots <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>bruised in the
distilled Water of Mallows, or Orange Flowers, for twelve hours, and
forcibly squeezing out the liquor, make, with this mucilage, and the
preceding Powders and Oils, a stiff Paste, which is to be dried in
the shade, and formed into round balls. Nothing exceeds this Soap for
smoothing the skin, or rendering the hands delicately white.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r250"></a>250. <i>Fine scented Wash-ball.</i></p>

<p>Take of the best White Soap, half a pound, and shave it into thin

half an ounce; Coriander-seeds, Lavender, and Bay Leaves, of each a
drachm, with three <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>drachms of Storax. Reduce the whole to fine powder,
which knead into a Paste with the Soap; adding a few grains of Musk or
Ambergrise. When you make this Paste into Wash-balls, soften it with
a little Oil of Almonds to render the composition more lenient. Too
much cannot be said in favour of this Wash-ball, with regard to its
cleansing and cosmetic property.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r251"></a>251. <i>A Wash-ball, an excellent Cosmetic for the Face and Hands.</i></p>

<p>Take a pound of Florentine Orrice, a quarter of a pound of Storax,
two ounces of Yellow Sanders, half an ounce of Cloves, as much fine
Cinnamon, a Nutmeg, and twelve grains of Ambergrise; beat the whole
into very fine powder and sift them through a lawn sieve, all ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>cept
the Ambergrise, which is to be added afterwards. Then take two pounds
of the finest White Soap, shaved small, and infuse it in three pints of
Brandy, four or five days. When it is dissolved, add a little Orange
Flower-water, and knead the whole into a very stiff Paste with the
best Starch finely powdered. Then mix the Ambergrise, with a little
Gum Tragacanth liquefied in sweet-scented Water. Of this Paste make
Wash-balls; dry them in the shade, and polish them with a Paste-board
or Lignum Vitæ cup.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r252"></a>252. <i>Bologna Wash-balls.</i></p>

Sanders, half an ounce of Orrice-root, and as much Calamus Aromaticus,
all finely powdered. Knead the whole into a Paste with Whites of Eggs,

ounce of St. Lucia Wood, and one Nutmeg. Reduce the whole to fine
powder; then take about two pounds or White Soap shaved thin, steep
it with the above Powder in three pints of Brandy, four or five days.
Afterwards kneading the mass with a sufficient quantity of Starch,
and adding to it the Whites of Eggs, with Gum Tragacanth dissolved in
some odoriferous Water, form the Paste into Wash-balls of what size
you please. A few grains of Musk or Civet, or a little Essential Oil
of Lavender, Bergamot, Roses, Cloves, Clove-july-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>flowers, Jasmine,
Cinnamon, in short, any that best pleases the fancy of the person who

<p class="plabel"><a id="r261"></a>261. <i>The Montpellier Toilet.</i></p>

<p>For this purpose a new light-woven linen cloth must be procured, and
cut of a proper size to make a toilet. The first <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>step you take must
be to wash the cloth perfectly clean in several different Waters,
then spread it out to dry, and afterwards steep it twenty-four hours
in Sweet-scented Water, viz. half Angelic, and half Rose-water. On
removing the cloth out of the water, gently squeeze it, and hang it up
to dry in the open air. Then lay on it the following composition.</p>

<p>Take dried Orange Flowers, Roots of Elecampane, and Florentine Orrice,
of each half a pound; of Yellow Sanders, four ounces; of the Marc or
Residuum of Angelic Water, two ounces; of Rose-wood and Sweet Flag,
each an ounce; of Gum Labdanum, Calamus Aromaticus, and Cloves, each
half an ounce; of Cinnamon, two drachms; beat all these ingredients
into powder, and make them into a Paste with Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>dissolved in Angelic Water. Rub this Paste hard on both sides of
your cloth, leaving on it the little bits that may adhere, because
they render the surface more smooth. Afterwards hang up the cloth,
and when half dry, again rub both sides, with a sponge wetted with
Angelic Water, to render the cloth yet more smooth; after which dry it
thoroughly, and fold it up. This cloth is generally lined with taffety,
and covered with sattin, and is never enclosed within more than two
pieces of some kind of thin silk, as Taffety, &amp;c.</p>

Repeat this operation three or four times, if they prove obstinate;
and they will afterwards soon waste away without leaving the least

<p>Take the inner Rind of a Lemon, steep it four and twenty hours in
distilled Vine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>gar, and apply it to the warts. It must not be left on
the part above three hours at a time, and is to be applied afresh every
day.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r266"></a>266. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Divide a Red Onion, and rub the warts well with it.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r267"></a>267. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Anoint the warts with the milky Juice of the herb Mercury several
times, and they will gradually waste away.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r268"></a>268. <i>Another safe and experienced Method.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Rub the warts with a pared Pippin, and a few days afterwards they will
be found to disappear.</p>

<h2><a name="VINEGARS" id="VINEGARS">VINEGARS.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r269"></a>269. <i>Distilled Vinegar.</i></p>

<p>Fill a stone cucurbit about three parts and a half full of White Wine
Vinegar; place the vessel in a furnace so contrived as to contain
three parts of the height of the cucurbit; mould the openings that
remain between the sides and the upper part of the vessel with clay
tempered with water; lute the vessel, fix on a receiver, and begin your
distillation with a moderate fire, which is to be increased by degrees
till about five sixths of the Vinegar are drawn off, which is called
Distilled Vinegar. A small quantity of acid Liquor still remains in the
cucurbit of the consistence of Honey, which if you think proper may be
dried hard by the assistance of a vapour-bath. The Vinegar distilled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>from this substance is infinitely more acid, than that which was drawn
off by the first process.</p>

<p>To rectify distilled Vinegar, put it into a clean vessel, setting it
in the same degree of fire as at first to separate more phlegm, and in
every thing proceed as before, till the bottom is almost dry. Neither
the fire nor distillation however must be urged too far, for fear of
giving an empyreumatic flavour to that which is already distilled.</p>

<p>Distilled Vinegar is used externally, mixed with Water, to wash the
face: it is cooling, and takes away the troublesome little pimples that
sometimes affect this part.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r270"></a>270. <i>Distilled Lavender Vinegar.</i></p>

<p>Put into a stone cucurbit any quantity of fresh-gathered Lavender
Flowers picked <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>clean from the Stalks; pour on them as much distilled
Vinegar as is requisite to make the Flowers float; distil in a
vapour-bath, and draw off about three fourths of the Vinegar.</p>

<p>In the same manner are prepared the Vinegars from all other vegetable
substances. Compound Vinegars are made by mixing several aromatic
substances together; observing only to bruise all hard woody
ingredients, and to let them infuse a sufficient time in the Vinegar
before you proceed to distillation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Lavender Vinegar is of use for the Toilet; it is cooling, and when
applied to the face, braces up the relaxed fibres of the skin.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r271"></a>271. <i>Vinegar of the Four Thieves.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Take of the tops of Sea and Roman Wormwood, Rosemary, Sage, Mint and
Rue, of each an ounce and a half; Lavender Flowers two ounces, Calamus
Aromaticus, Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmeg, and Garlic, of each a quarter of
an ounce; Camphire, half an ounce; Red Wine Vinegar, a gallon. Choose
all the foregoing ingredients dry, except the Garlic and Camphire; beat
them into gross powder, and cut the Garlic into thin slices; put the
whole into a matrass; pour the Vinegar on them, and digest the mixture
in the sun, or in a gentle sand-heat, for three weeks or a month. Then
strain off the Vinegar by expression, filter it through paper, and add
the Camphire dissolved in a little rectified Spirit of Wine. Keep it
for use in a bottle, tightly corked.</p>

<p>The Vinegar of the Four Thieves is antipestilential, and is used
successfully as a preservative against contagious disorders. The hands
and face are washed with it every day; the room fumigated with it, as
are also the clothes, in order to secure the person from infection.</p>

<p class="plabel"><a id="r272"></a>272. <i>To cure watery Eyes.</i></p>

<p>Prepare a decoction with the Leaves of Betony, Fennel Roots, and a
little fine Frankincense, which use as an Eye-water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r273"></a>273. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Frequently bathe the Eyes with a decoction of Chervil.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r274"></a>274. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Drop into the Eyes now and then a little Juice of Rue, mixed with
clarified Honey.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r275"></a>275. <i>An excellent Ophthalmic Lotion.</i></p>

<p>Take White Vitriol and Bay Salt, of each an ounce; decrepitate them
together, and when the detonation is over, pour on them, in an earthen
pan, a pint of boiling Water or Rose-water. Stir them together, and
let them stand some hours. A variously coloured skin will be formed on
the surface, which carefully skim off, and put the clear liquor into a
bottle for use.</p>

<p>This was communicated to the author as a great secret; and indeed he
has found it by experience very safely to cool <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>and repel those sharp
humours that sometimes fall upon the Eyes, and to clear the latter of
beginning films and specks. If too sharp, it may be diluted with a
little Rose-water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r276"></a>276. <i>An Ophthalmic Poultice.</i></p>

<p>Take half a pint of Alum Curd, and mix with it a sufficient quantity
of Red Rose Leaves powdered, to give it a proper consistence. This is
an excellent application for sore moist eyes, and admirably cools and
represses defluxions.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r277"></a>277. <i>A Poultice for inflamed Eyes.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Take half a pint of a decoction of Linseed in Water, and as much Flour
of Linseed as is sufficient to make it of a proper consistence. This
Poultice is preferable to a Bread and Milk Poultice for inflamed Eyes,
as it will not grow sour and acrid.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r278"></a>278. <i>Sir Hans Sloane's Eye Salve.</i></p>

<p>Take prepared Tutty, one ounce; prepared Bloodstone, two scruples;
Aloes in fine powder, twelve grains; mix them well together in a
marble mortar, with as much Viper's Fat as is requisite to bring the
whole to the consistence of a soft salve. It is to be applied with a
hair pencil, the eyes winking or a little opened. It has cured many
whose eyes were covered with opake films and scabs, left by preceding
disorders of those parts.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r279"></a>279. <i>An Ophthalmic Fomentation.</i></p>

<p>Take three quarters of an ounce of White Poppy Heads bruised with their
Seeds, and boil them in Milk and Water, of each half a pint, till one
half is wasted away; then dissolve in the strained Li<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>quor a scruple of

from <span class="smcap">Linen</span> and <span class="smcap">Stuffs</span>; and various other useful
Receipts.</p></blockquote>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r281"></a>281. <i>To take Iron Mould out of Linen.</i></p>

<p>Hold the Iron Mould over the Fume of Boiling Water for some time, then
pour on the spot a little Juice of Sorrel and a little Salt, and when
the cloth has thoroughly imbibed the Juice, wash it in Lee.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r282"></a>282. <i>To take out Stains of Oil.</i></p>

<p>Take Windsor Soap shaved thin, put it into a bottle half full of Lee,
throw in the size of a Nut of Sal Armoniac, a little Cabbage Juice, two
Yolks of new-laid Eggs, and Ox-gall at discretion, and lastly an ounce
of powdered Tartar: then cork <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>the bottle, and expose it to the heat of
the noon-day sun four days, at the expiration of which time it becomes
fit for use. Pour this Liquor on the stains, and rub it well on both
sides of the cloth; then wash the stains with clear Water, or rather
with the following soap, and when the cloth is dry, they will no longer
appear.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r283"></a>283. <i>Scowering Balls.</i></p>

<p>Take soft Soap, or Fuller's Earth; mix it with Vine Ashes sifted
through a fine sieve, and with powdered Chalk, Alum, and Tartar, of
each equal parts; form the mass into balls, which dry in the shade.
Their use is to rub on spots and stains, washing the spotted part
afterwards in clear Water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r284"></a>284. <i>To take out Stains of Coomb.</i></p>

<p>Put Butter on the stain, and rub it well with a piece of brown paper
laid on a heated silver spoon; then wash the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>whole in the same manner
as directed for spots of Wax.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r285"></a>285. <i>To take out Stains of Urine.</i></p>

<p>Wash the stained place well with boiled Urine, and afterwards wash it
in clear Water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r286"></a>286. <i>To take out Stains on Cloth of whatever Colour.</i></p>

<p>Take half a pound of Honey, the size of a Nut of Sal Armoniac, and the
Yolk of an Egg; mix them together, and put a little of this mixture on
the stain, letting it remain till dry. Then wash the cloth with fair
Water, and the stains will disappear. Water impregnated with mineral
Alkaline Salt or Soda, Ox-gall, and Black Soap, is also very good to
take out spots of grease.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r287"></a>287. <i>To take out Spots of Ink.</i></p>

<p>As soon as the accident happens, wet the place with Juice of Sorrel, or
Lemon, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>or with Vinegar, and the best hard White Soap.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r288"></a>288. <i>To take out Spots of Pitch and Turpentine.</i></p>

<p>Pour a good deal of Sallad Oil on the stained place, and let it dry on
it four and twenty hours; then rub the inside of the cloth with the
Scowering Ball and warm Water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r289"></a>289. <i>To take out Spots of Oil on Sattin and other Stuffs, and on
Paper.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>If the spot be not of long standing, take the Ashes of Sheep's Trotters
calcined, and apply them hot both under and upon the spot. Lay on it
something heavy, letting it remain all night; and if in the morning the
spot is not entirely effaced, renew the application repeatedly till it
wholly disappear.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r290"></a>290. <i>To take out Spots on Silk.</i></p>

<p>Rub the Spots with Spirit of Turpentine; this Spirit exhaling, carries
off with it the Oil that causes the Spot.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r291"></a>291. <i>Balls to take out Stains.</i></p>

<p>Take an ounce of Quick-lime, half a pound of Soap, and a quarter of a
pound of White Clay; moisten the whole with Water, and make it into
little balls, with which rub the stains, and afterwards wash them with
fair water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r292"></a>292. <i>To clean Gold and Silver Lace.</i></p>

<p>Take the Gall of an Ox and of a Pike, mixed well together in fair
Water, and rub the gold or silver with this composition.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r293"></a>293. <i>To restore to Tapestry its original Lustre.</i></p>

<p>Shake well, and thoroughly clean the tapestry; then rub it twice over
with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>Chalk, which, after remaining seven or eight hours each time, is
to be brushed off with a hard brush; the tapestry being likewise well
beaten with a stick, and shaked.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r294"></a>294. <i>To clean Turkey Carpets.</i></p>

<p>To revive the colour of a Turkey Carpet, beat it well with a stick,
till the dust is all got out; then with Lemon or Sorrel Juice take out
the spots of ink, if the carpet be stained with any; wash it in cold
Water, and afterwards shake out all the Water from the threads of the
carpet. When it is thoroughly dry, rub it all over with the Crumb of a
hot Wheaten Loaf; and if the weather is very fine, hang it out in the
open air a night or two.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r295"></a>295. <i>To refresh Tapestry, Carpets, Hangings, or Chairs.</i></p>

<p>Beat the dust out of them on a dry day as clean as possible, and brush
them <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>well with a dry brush. Afterwards rub them well over with a good
lather of Castile Soap, laid on with a brush. Wash off the froth with
common Water; then wash the tapestry, &amp;c. with Alum Water. When the
cloth is dry, you will find most of the colours restored. Those that
are yet too faint, touch up with a pencil dipped in suitable colours,
and indeed you may run over the whole piece in the same manner with
water colours, mixed with weak gum water, and, if well done, it will
cause the tapestry, &amp;c. to look at a distance like new.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r296"></a>296. <i>To take Wax out of Silk or Camblet.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Take Soft Soap, rub it well on the spots of wax, dry it in the sun till
it grows very hot, then wash the spotted part with cold Water, and the
wax will be entirely taken out.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r297"></a>297. <i>To take Wax out of Velvet of all Colours except Crimson.</i></p>

<p>Take a Crummy Wheaten Loaf, cut it in two, toast it before the fire,
and while very hot, apply it to the part spotted with wax. Then apply
another piece of toasted Bread hot as before, and continue to repeat
this application till the wax is entirely taken out.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r298"></a>298. <i>To wash Gold or Silver Work on Linen, or any other Stuff, so as
to look like new.</i></p>

<p>Take a pound of Ox-gall; Honey and Soap, of each three ounces;
Florentine Orrice in fine powder, three ounces; mix the whole in a
glass vessel into a Paste, and expose it to the sun during ten days;
then make a decoction of Bran, and strain it clear. Plaster over with
your bitter Paste, the places you want to clean, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>afterwards wash
off the Paste with the Bran-water, till the latter is no longer tinged.
Then wipe with a clean linen cloth the places you have washed; cover
them with a clean napkin, dry them in the sun, press and glaze, and the
work will look as well as when new.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r299"></a>299. <i>To take Spots out of Silken or Woollen Stuffs.</i></p>

<p>Take a sufficient quantity of the finest Starch, wet it in an earthen
pipkin with Brandy, rub a little on the spots, let it dry on them, and
then brush it off; repeat this operation till the spots are wholly
taken out. You must be careful to beat and brush well the place on
which the Starch was applied.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r300"></a>300. <i>To take Stains of Oil out of Cloth.</i></p>

<p>Take Oil of Tartar, pour a little on the spot, immediately wash the
place with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>warm Water, and two or three times after with cold Water,
and the spot will entirely disappear.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r301"></a>301. <i>To take Stains out of White Cloth.</i></p>

<p>Boil an ounce of Alum in a gallon and a half of Water, for half an
hour, then add a piece of White Soap, and half a ounce more of Alum,
and after it has stood in cold infusion two days, wash with this
mixture stains in any kind of white cloth.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r302"></a>302. <i>To take Stains out of Crimson Velvet, and coloured Velvets.</i></p>

<p>Take a quart of strong Lee made with Vine Ashes, dissolve in it half
an ounce of Alum; and when the mixture has settled, strain it through
a linen cloth. Then take half a drachm of soft Soap, and the same
quantity of Castile Soap, a drachm of Alum, half a drachm of Crude Sal
Armo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>niac, a scruple of common Salt, a little Loaf Sugar, Juice of
Celandine, and the Gall of a Calf; mix the whole well, and strain off
the Liquor. When you want to use it, take a little Brazil Wood Shavings
with some Scarlet Flocks, boil them in this Liquor, and when strained
off, it will be very good to take spots or stains out of crimson velvet
or cloth. For velvets or cloths of other colours, you dye your Liquor
of the proper colour, by boiling in it some Flocks of the same colour
as the cloth you intend to clean.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r303"></a>303. <i>A Soap that takes out all manner of Spots and Stains.</i></p>

<p>Take the Yolks of six Eggs, half a table spoonful of bruised Salt,
and a pound of Venetian Soap; mix the whole together with the Juice
of Beet-roots, and form it into round balls, that are to be dried in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>the shade. The method of using this Soap is to wet with fair Water
the stained part of the cloth, and rub both sides of it well with this
Soap; then wash the cloth in Water, and the stain will no longer appear.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r304"></a>304. <i>Another Method to take Spots or Stains out of White Silk or
Crimson Velvet.</i></p>

<p>First soak the place well with Brandy or Spirit of Wine, then rub it
over with the White of a new-laid Egg, and dry it in the sun. Wash
it briskly in cold Water, rubbing the place where the spot is, hard
between the fingers; and repeat this operation a second and even a
third time, if it has not previously succeeded.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r305"></a>305. <i>A Receipt to clean Gloves without wetting.</i></p>

<p>Lay the Gloves upon a clean board; and mix together Fuller's Earth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>Powder of Alum very dry, which lay over them on both sides with a
moderately stiff brush. Then sweep off the Powder, sprinkle them well
with Bran and Whiting, and dust them thoroughly. If not very greasy,
this will render them as clean as when new; but if they are extremely
greasy, rub them with stale Crumb of Bread, and Powder of burnt Bones,
then pass them over with a woollen Cloth dipped in Fuller's Earth or
Alum Powder.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r306"></a>306. <i>To colour Gloves.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>If you want to colour them of a dark colour, take Spanish Brown and
Black Earth; if lighter, Yellow Ochre and Whiting, and so of the rest;
mix the colour with Size of a moderate strength, then wet the Gloves
over with the Colour, and hang them to dry gradually. Beat out the
superfluous Colour, smooth them over with a sleeking stick, and reduce
them to a proper size.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r307"></a>307. <i>To wash Point Lace.</i></p>

<p>Draw the Lace pretty tight in a frame, then with a lather of Castile
Soap a little warm, rub it over gently by means of a fine brush. When
you perceive it clean on one side, turn it, and rub the other in the
same manner; then throw over the Lace some Alum-water, taking off the
Suds, and with some thin Starch go over the wrong side of the Lace;
iron it on the same side when dry, and raise the flowers with a bodkin.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r308"></a>308. <i>To clean Point Lace without washing.</i></p>

<p>Fix the lace in a frame, and rub it with Crumb of stale Bread, which
afterwards dust out.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r309"></a>309. <i>To wash black and white Sarcenet.</i></p>

<p>Lay the silk smooth upon a board, spread a little Soap over the dirty
places, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>make a lather with Castile Soap, and with a fine brush dipped
in it, pass over the silk the right way, viz. lengthways, and continue
so to do till that side is sufficiently scowered. Then turn the silk,
scower the other side in the same manner, and put the silk into boiling
Water, where it must lie some time; afterwards rince it in thin Gum
Water; if white silk, add a little Smalt. This being done, fold the
silk, clapping or pressing out the water with your hands on a dry
Carpet, till it become tolerably dry; if white, dry it over the Smoak
of Brimstone till ready for smoothing, which is to be done on the right
side with an Iron moderately hot.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r310"></a>310. <i>A Soap to take out all Kinds of Stains.</i></p>

<p>Boil a handful of Strawberries or Strawberry Leaves in a quart of Water
and a pint of Vinegar, adding two pounds of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>Castile Soap; and half a
pound of Chalk in fine powder; boil them together till the water has
evaporated. When you use it, wet the place with the sharpest Vinegar or
Verjuice, and rub it over with this Soap; dry it afterwards before the
fire or in the sun.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r311"></a>311. <i>An expeditious Method to take Stains out of Scarlet, or Velvet of
any other Colour.</i></p>

<p>Take Soapwort, when bruised strain out its Juice, and add to it a small
quantity of black Soap. Wash the Stain with this Liquor, suffering it
to dry between whiles; and by this means, in a day or two the Spots
will disappear.</p>

<h2><a name="DIFFERENT_WAYS_OF_PREPARING_SNUFF" id="DIFFERENT_WAYS_OF_PREPARING_SNUFF">DIFFERENT WAYS OF PREPARING SNUFF.</a></h2>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r312"></a>312. <i>Method of making Snuff.</i></p>

<p>First strip off the Stalks and large fibres of the Tobacco, then spread
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>Leaves on a mat or carpet to dry in the sun, afterwards rub them
in a mortar, and sift the powder through a coarse or fine sieve,
according to the degree of fineness you would have your snuff; or
grind the Tobacco Leaves, prepared in the manner before directed, in a
snuff-mill, either into a gross or fine powder, according as you press
close or ease the mill-stone.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r313"></a>313. <i>Method of cleansing Snuff in order to scent it.</i></p>

<p>Fix a thick linen cloth in a little tub that has a hole in the bottom,
stopped with a plug that can easily be taken out, to let the water run
off when wanted. This cloth must cover the whole inside of the tub,
and be fastened all round the rim. Put your Snuff in it, and pour on
the Water. When it has been steeped twenty-four hours, let the Water
run out, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>and pour on fresh; repeat this operation three times, if you
would have the Snuff thoroughly cleansed, and every time squeeze the
Snuff hard in the cloth, to discharge the Water entirely from it. Then
place your Snuff on an ozier hurdle covered with a thick linen cloth,
and let it dry in the sun; when it is thoroughly dry, put it again
into the tub, with a sufficient quantity of Angelic, Orange Flower, or
Rose-water. At the expiration of twenty-four hours take the Snuff out
of the water, and dry it as before, frequently stirring it about, and
sprinkling it with the same sweet-scented Water as was used at first.
The whole of this preparation is absolutely necessary to render Snuff
fit to receive the scent of Flowers.</p>

<p>If the Snuff is not required to be of a very excellent quality, and
you are unwil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>ling to waste more of it than can possibly be avoided,
wash it only once, and slightly cleanse it. This purgation may the
better suffice, if while drying in the sun, you take care to knead
the Snuff into a cake several times, and often sprinkle it with some
sweet-scented Water.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r314"></a>314. <i>Method of scenting Snuff.</i></p>

<p>The Flowers that most readily communicate their flavour to Snuff are
Orange Flowers, Jasmine, Musk Roses, and Tuberoses. You must procure
a box lined with dry white paper; in this strow your Snuff on the
bottom about the thickness of an inch, over which place a thin layer of
Flowers, then another layer of Snuff, and continue to lay your Flowers
and Snuff alternately in this manner, until the box is full. After they
have lain together four and twenty hours, sift your Snuff through a
sieve to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>separate it from the Flowers, which are to be thrown away,
and fresh ones applied in their room in the former method. Continue
to do this till the Snuff is sufficiently scented; then put it into a
canister, which keep close stopped.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r315"></a>315. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Put your Flowers that are placed over each layer of the Snuff,
between two pieces of white paper pricked full of holes with a large
pin, and sift through a sieve the Snuff that may happen to get between
the papers. To scent the Snuff perfectly it is necessary to renew the
Flowers four or five times. This method is the least troublesome of the
two.</p>

<p>A very agreeable scented Snuff may be made with Roses, by taking
Rose-buds, stripping off the green cup, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>pistil that rises in the
middle, and fixing in its place a Clove; being careful not to separate
the Leaves that are closed together. The Rose-buds thus prepared, are
to be exposed to the heat of the sun a whole month, inclosed in a glass
well stopped, and are then fit for use.</p>

<p>To make Snuff scented with a thousand Flowers, take a number of
different Flowers, and mix them together, proportioning the quantity of
each Flower, to the degree of its perfume, so that the flavour of no
one particular Flower may be predominant.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r316"></a>316. <i>Perfumed Snuff.</i></p>

<p>Take some Snuff, and rub it in your hands with a little Civet, opening
the body of the Civet still more by rubbing it in your hands with fresh
Snuff; and when you have mixed it perfectly with the Snuff, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>put them
into a canister. Snuff is flavoured with other perfumes in the same way.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r317"></a>317. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Perfume your Snuff by mixing it well with the hands, in a heated iron
or brass mortar, besmeared with a few grains of Ambergrise.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r318"></a>318. <i>Snuff after the Maltese Fashion.</i></p>

<p>Perfume with Ambergrise, in the manner already described, some Snuff
previously scented with Orange Flowers. Then grind in a mortar a little
Sugar with about ten grains of Civet, and mix by little and little with
about a pound of the foregoing Snuff.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r319"></a>319. <i>The Genuine Maltese Snuff.</i></p>

<p>Take Roots of Liquorice, and Roots of the Rose-bush, peel off their
outer skin, dry them, powder them, and sift the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>powder through a fine
sieve, then scent them according to your fancy, or in the same manner
as French Snuff, adding a little White Wine, Brandy, or a very little
Spirit of Wine, and rubbing the Snuff well between your hands.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r320"></a>320. <i>Italian Snuff.</i></p>

<p>Put into a mortar, or other convenient vessel, a quantity of Snuff
already scented with some Flower, pour on it a little White Wine, and
add, if agreeable, some Essence of Ambergrise, Musk, or any other
Perfume you like best; stir the Snuff and rub it well between your
hands. Scent Snuff in this manner with any particular flavour, and put
the different scented Snuffs in separate boxes, which are to be marked,
to prevent mistakes.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r321"></a>321. <i>Snuff scented after the Spanish Manner.</i></p>

<p>Take a lump of double-refined Sugar, rub it in a mortar with twenty
grains of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>Musk; add by little and little a pound of Snuff, and grind
the whole with ten grains of Civet, rubbing it afterwards well between
your hands.</p>

<p>Seville Snuff is scented with twenty grains of Vanilloes only. Keep
your Snuff in canisters closely stopped, to prevent the scent from
exhaling.</p>

<p>As Spanish Snuff is very fine and of a reddish colour, to imitate it
nicely, take the best Dutch Snuff, well cleansed, granulated, and
coloured red; beat it fine, and sift it through a very fine lawn sieve.
After it has been cleansed according to the foregoing directions, it is
fit to take any scent whatever.</p>

<p>There is no risk in using a sieve that retains the scent of any Flower,
to perfume your Snuff with the flavour of Musk, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>Ambergrise, or any
other Perfume. On the contrary, the Snuff receives the Perfume the more
readily, and preserves its flavour the longer on that account.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r322"></a>322. <i>Method of dying Snuff Red or Yellow.</i></p>

<p>Take the size of a nut or two of Yellow or Red Ochre, and to temper
the colour mix with it a little White Chalk. Grind these colours
on a marble, with a little less than half an ounce of Oil of Sweet
Almonds, and moisten with as much Water as the colour will take up,
till it becomes a smooth Paste. Then mix it with a thin Mucilage of
Gum Tragacanth to a proper consistence, and put it into an earthen
dish, stirring into it about a pint more of Water. Afterwards take any
quantity of cleansed Snuff you please, throw it upon the colour, and
rub it well between your hands. When the Paste is thoroughly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>tinged
with the colour, leave it till next morning to settle, then spread it
thin on a cloth to dry, and place it in the sun, stirring it about
every now and then that it may dry equally. When dry, gum it with a
very thin Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth made with some sweet-scented
Water. To gum the Snuff as equally as possible, wet the palms of
your hands with this Gum Water, and rub the Snuff well between them.
Afterwards dry it in the sun, and sift the colour that does not adhere
to it through a very fine sieve. The Snuff is then properly prepared to
receive any flavour you choose.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r323"></a>323. <i>Herb Snuff.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Take Sweet Marjoram, Marum Syriacum Leaves, and Lavender Flowers dried,
of each half an ounce, Asarabacca Leaves, a drachm. Rub them all into a
powder.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r324"></a>324. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take Betony Leaves and Marjoram, of each half an ounce; Asarabacca
Leaves, a drachm. Beat them together into a powder.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r325"></a>325. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take Marjoram, Rosemary Flowers, Betony, and Flowers of Lilies of the
Valley, of each a quarter of an ounce; Nutmegs, a drachm and a half;
Volatile Salt, forty drops. Powder, and keep the mixture in a phial,
close stopped.</p>


<p class="plabel"><a id="r326"></a>326. <i>Or,</i></p>

<p>Take Flowers of Lavender, and Clove-july-flowers, of each a quarter
of an ounce; Lilies of the Valley, Tiel-tree Flowers, Flowers of
Sage, Betony, Rosemary, and Tops of Marjoram, of each half a drachm;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>Cinnamon, Aloes-wood, Yellow Sanders, and White Helebore-root, of each
a drachm; Oil of Nutmegs and Oil of Lemons, of each three drops; mix
them into a powder.</p>

<p>A pinch or two of any of these Snuffs may be taken night and morning
medicinally, or at any time for pleasure. Used externally, they are
serviceable for weak eyes and many disorders of the organs of sight and
hearing. They also relieve headaches, giddiness, palsies, lethargies,
besides a variety of other complaints; and are, though agreeable and
simple, far superior to what is sold under the name of Herb Snuff.</p>
